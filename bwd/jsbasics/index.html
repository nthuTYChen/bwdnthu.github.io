					<p>For many people new to this area, <em>computer programming</em> sounds pretty scary. But Web programming is actually <em class="extra">a lot easier</em> than other types of computer programming (quantum computing? Gee...). JavaScript is also very straightforward, and with the foundation you have built in previous tutorials, you should be able to adapt to it very quickly...let along the fact that people have created a more convenient version of JavaScript - jQuery - which you will learn in the next unit.</p>
					<p>Let's begin with some preparation works. First of all, create a <em class="extra">js</em> directory right under the <em>root</em> directory (namely, <em>/js</em>), which should include global JavaScript (henceforth, JS) files for your entire website. You can create different <em>js</em> directory for each website project in their sub-directory, but we will write some demo codes in the <em>/js</em> directory first.</p>
					<p>Let's first create a <em class="extra">demo.js</em> file in the <em>/js</em> directory. To allow your webpage to run the JS codes in demo.js, we need to load it to your webpage using the <code>&lt;script&gt;</code> element. Insert the following line to your <code>&lt;head&gt;</code> section of your <em>index.html</em> under your <em>root</em> directory, assuming that you did what I said above:</p>
					<code>&lt;script src="/js/demo.js"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;</code>
					<p>To check if the JS file is embedded correctly into the webpage, add the following line to your <em>demo.js</em>:</p>
					<code>alert('embedded!');</code>
					<p>After you update your website and reload the index page, you should be able to see a pop-up message showing the message <em class="extra">embedded!</em>.</p>
					<p>And let's go back again to the useful <em class="extra">Developer Tools</em> hidden in your Web browser, and this time look at the <em class="extra">Console</em> tab:</p>
					<picture>
						<img src="img/devtools.png"/>
					</picture>
					<p>When we try to <em class="extra">debug</em> your JS codes, you will be using this part of the tools a lot. I mean, <em>A LOT</em>. Let's see how it works. Now, add the following line to your <em>demo.js</em>:</p>
					<code>console.log('logged!');</code>
					<p>Again, update your website and reload the index page - in addition to the same pop-up message, you should see the new message in the Console tab of your Developer Tools.</p>
					<p>If everything goes as expected, then you are ready for your journey of JS programming!</p>
				</section>
				<section>
					<h2 id="jssyntax">JavaScript syntax, a breakdown</h2>
					<p>The codes you will see in a JS file could be in general categorized into two types - <em class="extra">statement</em> and <em class="extra">code blocks</em>. We have seen some <em>statements</em> when we were preparing for our JS programming above, one of which is repeated here:</p>
					<code>alert('embedded!');</code>
					<p>This is a simplified statement that will be translated in an order by a Web browser as <q>show a pop-up message 'embedded!' in the browser window!</q>. The most important thing about a statement in a JS file is that it ends with a <em class="extra">semi-colon</em> <code>;</code>, which indicates <em>the end</em> of a statement. Interestingly, if you remove the semi-colon from the statement above, you'll still see the pop-up message. This does not suggest that the semi-colon is not important - it's just that your Web browser is smart enough to ignore the mistake you make.</p>
					<p>A good example showing the importance of semi-colon in a statement is to put the two statements we used above in the same line as:</p>
					<code>alert('embedded!'); console.log('logged!');</code>
					<p>Not only will you see the same pop-up message again, you will also see the text message in the console tab of your Developer Tools. This means that statements are processed based on the ending indicated by semi-colons, rather than by separate lines - of course, we still put individual statements in separate lines for <em>a better readibility</em>. So, <em>always</em> add a semi-colons at the end of a statement.</p>
					<p>A <em>code block</em> is just a collection of statements represented with a pair of curved brackets <code>{ }</code>. We have seen the adoption of this concept in the CSS tutorials, in which curved brackets include a collection of CSS properties, and we will extend this concept to <em>objects</em> when we get to <a href="#variable">Variable</a> part. In the following example, we have a code block containing the two statements introduced previously:</p>
					<code>
						{
							<code>
								alert('embedded!');<br/>
								console.log('logged!');<br/>
							</code>
						}
					</code>
					<p>We need to use code blocks from time to time in special occassions: Repeat the same statements for multiple times (see <a href="#loop">Loop</a>), run different sets of statements  when different conditions are met (see <a href="#ifelse">If...else...</a>), etc. So code block is just very convenient for programmers. Again, the tradition is to have each statement <em class="extra">indented from the left edge</em> when it is included in a code block to better show where it belongs, and this is why a good editor like Sublime Text also does this for you automatically in a JS file. If you align all statements to the left edge, it won't matter; the statements will still be processed normally by Web browsers. It just creates a mess for you (and your partners in a collaborative project).</p>
					<p>The most frequent type of statements you probably will write and see would involve some <em>operator</em> <code>=</code>, as in the following line:</p>
					<code>num = 5;</code>
					<p>This <code>= (equal)</code> operator assigns the value to its right (<em>5</em>) to a container named <em>num</em> to its left. More details about this process will be given in the <a href="#variable">Variable</a> section below, but my point here is to bring up another <em>tradition</em> in coding that is not specific to JS. That is, when there's an operator in a statement, we tend to leave a space on both sides of it, again for a <em>better readibility</em> of your codes. You can remove the spaces and will find the processing of your codes unaffected, but it's not as clear in your text editor.</p>
					<p>Finally, as in the case of HTML and CSS, you can also add some notes in your JS file using <code>//</code> or <code>/**/</code>. By adding <code>//</code> before some texts in a JS file, the texts after <code>//</code> in the same line are treated as a <em>comment</em>, rather than part of JS codes:</p>
					<p><code>// This is a comment!</code></p>
					<p>We also frequently use <code>//</code> to <em>temporarily</em> comment out a statement when debugging our codes:</p>
					<code>
						//No more pop-up message!<br/>
						//alert('embedded!');<br/>
						console.log('logged!');
					</code>

					<p>When you do grocery shopping, you don't go back and forth between shelves and the casher. Instead, you get a basket or a cart with you. You grab goods on the shelves and put them into your basket/cart. Later, you would simply check your container to see the number of things there, and you don't have to go back to every corner in the grocery store to count how many times you grab things from the shelves. Of course, you could change the things in your container freely, but still, you only need to count the number of things in that container.</p>
					<p>All programming languagues have such a container for storing information, from which you can re-use the information easily - it's called <em class="extra">variable</em>. In JS, you can use the keyword <code>var</code> to declare a variable, as in the following example:</p>
					<code><p>var num; // Declare a variable named "num"</p></code>
					<p>And we can put things into the container (I mean, variable) with the <code>=</code> operator introduced in the previous section:</p>
					<code><p>var num = 5; // Declare a variable named "num" equal to a numeric value of 5</p></code>
					<p>It's also possible to declare a variable first without assigning its value, mostly because the value will be assigned in other statements later. In this case, the variable has a <code>undefined</code> value, since it's value is not defined just yet:</p>
					<code>var undefinedVar; // This variable has a "undefined" value</code>
					<p>Let's try to print the value of both variables in the console tab of our Developer Tools to verify my claims:</p>
					<code>
						console.log(num); // Print the value of "num"<br/>
						console.log(undefinedVar); // Print the value of "undefinedVar"
					</code>
					<p>Now, if someone start a conversation with you by saying <q>Did I tell you I love him so much?</q>, your first question would naturally be <q>Who the hell is <em>him</em>?</q>. Your question stems from the fact the referent of the pronoun is <em>not defined</em> in the conversational context. Similarly, in JS you cannot have access to the value of a variable before you declare it in your code:</p>
					<code>
						console.log(him); // Who the hell is "him"?<br/>
						var him = 'Mike'; // Give me this info first!
					</code>
					<p>Intriguingly, if you separate variable declaration from value assignment, it is in fact possible to get the value of the variable even if the variable declaration is the <em>last</em> statement in your code:</p>
					<code>
						him = 'Mike';<br/>
						console.log(him); // I know who 'him' is!<br/>
						var him;
					</code>
					<p>This is because variable declaration is always <em class="extra">hoisted</em> in JS, so the above code is automatically interpreted as:</p>
					<code>
						var him; // Hoisted variable declaration<br/>
						him = 'Mike';<br/>
						console.log(him); // I know who 'him' is!
					</code>
					<p>Being allowed to drink a dozen of beer doesn't mean you SHOULD drink a dozen of beer - why do you want to stupidly declare a variable in the last statement and let JS to figure it out by itself? <em class="extra">Always declare your variables first</em>, whether they are assigned a value right away.</p>
					<p>Once you have declared a variable with <code>var</code>, you can always assign a new value to it later without <code>var</code>:</p>
					<code>
						var newVal = 0; // Declare a new variable with a value 0<br/>
						console.log(newVal); // Output = 0<br/>
						newVal = 5; // Assign a new value<br/>
						console.log(newVal); // Output = 5
					</code>
					<p>You can also freely assign a value of a different type (for instance, a string, see below) to a declared variable, but it's going to be a <em>very bad practice</em>. A variable is usually created to serve a particular function, such as storing the name of a user, the type of the user's browser, the time the user spends on your website, etc., so it's usually not the case in which you need a variable to store both a numeric value and certain text info. And that's why we need a logical sense of naming.</p>
					<h3>The sense/rules of variable naming</h3>
					<p>When you declare a variable, it is also important give your variable a semantically meaningful name. In the above example, my first variable is named <code>num</code> because...it's assigned a numeric value. The second one is <code>nullVar</code> because it is not assigned any value. This logic is similar to those applied to the use of HTML elements - to be <em class="extra">semantically meaningful</em>. No one would stop you using random variable names like x, y, z, etc., but later you would have a hard time recalling the meaning of these variables. In addition to the above guideline, there are some more rules that you must be aware of before moving on:</p>
					<ul>
						<li><em>A variable name cannot include any space</em>, so when I need to combine multiple words for a meaningful variable name, I always capitalize the first letter of a word in the name to make it more readible, just like the <code>nullVar</code> variable above.</li>
						<li><em>A variable name cannot start with a digit letter</em>, so a variable name like <code>1stVar</code> won't work.</li>
						<li><em>Most symbols are reserved for special use</em>, like the operators <code>=</code>, <code>+</code>, etc. The best way to avoid this problem is not to have any symbol in your variable name.</li>
						<li><em>There is also a list of reserved words</em>, like the <code>var</code> keyword, which cannot be used as a variable name. See a complete list on this <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/js/js_reserved.asp" target="blank">W3CSchool page</a>.</li>
					</ul>
					<p>Interestingly, you can use weird Unicode characters in your variable name, like <em>ಠ_ಠ</em>:</p>
					<code>
						var ಠ_ಠ; // Declare a variable with a weird name<br/>
						console.log(ಠ_ಠ); // You should get "undefined"
					</code>
					<p>I would suggest no one to include any special Unicode characters in your variable names - imagine how emoticons could annoy other people trying to read your codes, for instance. Just use the regular English alphabet. If you have any conern over your variable names, you can check their validity on <a href="https://mothereff.in/js-variables" target="blank">this page</a>.</p>
					<p>Lastly, I would like to remind you that everything in JS are <em class="extra">case-sensitive</em>:</p>
					<code>
						var num = 5;<br/>
						var Num = 10;<br/>
						console.log(num); // It's impossible to be 10<br/>
						console.log(Num); // It's impossible to be 5
					</code>
					<h3>Number, string, and operators</h3>
					<p>In the above examples, we see how to assign a value to a variable via the operator <code>=</code>, but the assigned value could also be the result of some mathematical calculations using the operators <code>+</code>, <code>-</code>, <code>*</code> (multiply), and <code>/</code> (divide), as in the following cases:</p>
					<code>
						var math1 = 2 + 5;<br/>
						var math2 = 3 * 4.5;<br/>
						var math3 = 1 - 5 * 40;
					</code>
					<p>Crucially, your formula can include other variables that are assigned a value <em class="extra">earlier</em>:</p>
					<code>
						var num = 5;<br/>
						var newNum = 4 + num;
					</code>
					<p>So far, the focus has been on variables that are assigned a numeric value, but of course we have many different types of data that can be stored into a variable. The data type we will be using a lot in JS, especially when we need to make our webpages interactive, is <em class="extra">string</em>. In JS, a string must be enclosed inside a pair of single/double quotation marks, as in the following example:</p>
					<code>var stringVar = 'Here is a string!';</code>
					<p>Whether you use single or double quotation marks doesn't really matter, as long as you are <em>consistent</em>. You can't have a single quotation mark on the one side but a double quotation mark on the other:</p>
					<code>var wrongStringVar = <em>'</em>This will not work!<em>"</em>; /* You will see some error message in the console */</code>
					<p>I prefer to use <em>single</em> quotation mark just because it's easier to type (you need <em>shift + '</em> to get a double quotation mark). Yes, I'm just a lazybone. The only minor issue that you might encounter is when your string also has some single quotation marks. In this case, you need to add a <em class="extra">backslash</em> <code>\</code> before each special symbol to <em>escape</em> the character (namely, to tell a Web browser that this single quotation mark should be treated as a regular character, not a special symbol):</p>
					<code>var stringWithQuote = 'Here<em>\</em>'s a single quotation mark!';</code>
					<p>In JS, you could also easily combine numeric and string values as a <em>string</em> using the <code>+</code> operator:</p>
					<code>
						console.log('A number: '+5); // Output = 'A number 5';<br/>
						var num = 5;<br/>
						var str = 'A number ';<br/>
						console.log(str+num); // The output is the same;
					</code>
					<p>Let's have a small test here - what is the value of the two variables <code>test1</code> and <code>test2</code> below?</p>
					<code>
						var test1 = 'Value: ' + 5 + 10;<br/>
						var test2 = 'Value: ' + 5 * 10;
					</code>
					<p>Of course, it is not possible to use other operators for numeric and string values:</p>
					<code>
						var wrongVar = 'Value ' * 5; // What is this supposed to mean anyway?<br/>
						var cantDoThis = 'Get rid of A' - 'A'; // Nope. You can't take out a string in this way.
					</code>
					<p>The distiction between numeric and string values are particularly important for digit letters 0-9; when digits are enclosed inside quotation marks, they are viewed as a string, rather a numeric sequence:</p>
					<code>
						var numAsNum = 5; // A numeric value 5 is assigned to "numAsNum"<br/>
						var numAsStr = '5'; // A string value '5' is assigned to "numAsStr"<br/>
						console.log(numAsNum + numAsStr); // The output is a string '55', not a numeric value 25
					</code>
					<p>It is always possible to convert a string composed of digits into a numeric value with two JS functions <code>parseInt()</code> and <code>Number()</code> (we will get to the function section pretty soon). The main difference is that <code>parseInt()</code> always round the target number:</p>
					<code>
						var strNum1 = '11.99';<br/>
						console.log(1 + strNum1); // Output = '111.99'<br/>
						strNum1 = parseInt(strNum1); // Convert the value of "strNum1" in to a numeric value assigned to "strNum1"<br/>
						console.log(1 + strNum1); // Output = 12
					</code>

					<h2 id="arrayobj">Array and object</h2>
					<picture>
						<img src="img/array.png"/>
					</picture>
					<p>Now let's move on to some more advanced data types - <em>array</em> and <em>object</em>. You could imagine an array of data to be a train, and each carriage is stored with their own data. Maybe just look at the code directly:</p>
					<code>var numArray = [1, 5, 2, 11, 7]; // An array of five numeric values</code>
					<p>In the above example, you see a train of data defined by a pair of <em>square brackets</em> <code>[ ]</code>, in which every two carriages are seperated from each other with a <em>comma</em>. Each carriage has its own value, and the entire train is assigned to the variable <code>numArray</code>. The value in each carriage can be accessed or replaced by specifying the number of the carriage (or more precisely, the <em>index</em> of an array position) in <code>[ ]</code>, starting with <code>0</code> (thus the picture you saw above):</p>
					<code>
						var anArrayValue = numArray[0]; // Get the first value of an array<br/>
						console.log(anArrayValue); // Output = 1<br/>
						anArrayValue = numArray[1]; // Get the second value of the array<br/>
						console.log(anArrayValue); // Output = 5<br/>
						numArray[1] = 18; // Replace the second value of the array with 18<br/>
						console.log(numArray[1]); // Output = 18
					</code>
					<p>Why does the index of an array position start with <code>0</code> not <code>1</code>? I didn't dig very deep into the history, but one speculation that I have seen on the internet is that <code>0</code> is <em class="extra">the first natural number</em> in math. I'm not a mathmatician, neither a computer scientist, so you can do your own research. But things won't change with your complains, so let's deal with it and remember that the index starts with <code>0</code>.</p>
					<p>Again, things are pretty free in JS, so an array in JS can have different types of data in different positions, as in the following example:</p>
					<code>var mixedArray = [1, 'hello!', 'yes!', 9, 87]; // An array with mixed data types</code>
					<p>However, you should not take this feature for granted and always use arrays with different types of data in different positions. Supposed that you use an array to store the profile of a person, the organization might make sense in the first place, but soon you will forget which position stores which part of the profile info:</p>
					<code>var profile = ['TY Chen', 'NTHU', 39, 180, 72]; // Name, Affiliation, Age, Height, Weight </code>
					<p>Instead, an array is best used to store <em class="extra">homogeneous</em> data, that is, data that represent similar info. For instance, if you have multiple phone numbers, you can use an array to store them:</p>
					<code>var phoneNums = [0937149506, 0956771481, 0982982143]; // Don't call any of these!</code>
					<p>When you use an array to store homogeneous data, the index number makes sense - the first phone number, the second phone number, and so on:</p>
					<code>
						phoneNums[0]; // The first phone number<br/>
						phoneNums[1]; // The second phone number<br/>
						...
					</code>
					<p>It is also possible to declare an <em>empty</em> array if the values in it will be determined later. A new value could be inserted by directly specifying the position where the value is stored to:</p>
					<code>
						var emptyArray = []; // Leave nothing in the square brackets<br/>
						emptyArray[0] = 1; // Insert a value 1 to the array's first position<br/>
						console.log(emptyArray[0]); // Output = 1
					</code>
					<p>A quick test: What's the output you will get by running the following codes?</p>
					<code>
						var emptyArray [];<br/>
						emptyArray[1] = 1; // Insert a value 1 to the array's second position<br/>
						console.log(emptyArray[0]); // What's the output?
					</code>
					<p>It would certainly be a rare occassion for you to create an empty array first and insert values by skipping some positions. But since you might make a common mistake (for instance, forget that the first position is <code>0</code>), it's good to know how the above case works.</p>
					<p>The above examples include arrays that have only <em class="extra">one single dimension</em>; since you only need one <em>coordinate</em> to identify the position of a value in it. Since each position can be stored with any type of data, it is possible for each position of a single-dimensional array to contain another single-dimensional array, and the entire array becomes a <em>two-dimensional</em> array:</p>
					<code>
						var multiDArray = [[2, 3, 4], [11, 24, 25], [9, 0, 1]]; // A 3-by-3 2D array<br/>
						console.log(multiDArray[0][1]); // Output = 2<br/>
						console.log(multiDArray[2][0]); // Output = 9
					</code>
					<p>The codes shouldn't be too difficult to understand - the variable <code>multiDArray</code> is declared as a one-dimensional array with <code>[ ]</code>, in which each position is stored with another one-dimensional array with <code>[ ]</code>. When try to access this two-dimensional array, you use two paris of <code>[ ]</code>. The first pair specifies the index of the outer array, as in <code>multiDArray[0]</code>. Since the first position of the outer array is another array, you use the second pair to specify the index of this inner array, as in <code>multiDArray[0][1]</code> - now you have access to the first position of <code>multiDArray</code> and then second position of <code>multiDArray[0]</code>, which gives you the output of <code>2</code>. The same logic applies to <code>multiDArray[2][0]</code>. In Web design, a one-dimensional array would suffice in most cases. For instance, when we retrieve a group of HTML elements from a webpage in JS, they will be presented in a one-dimensional array. Remember, an array is mostly used to store homegeneous data. Before you go for a two-dimensional array or even beyond that, you need to think carefully if you really need this level of <em>coding complexity</em>, or whether using an <em>object</em> will be a better choice.</p>
					<h3>Object-oriented programming</h3>
					<p>An object is suitable for a complex data structure, especially when there's no better way of presenting this complex data structure. Let's go back to our <em>profile</em> example. I have demonstrated why array is not a good container for a profile, since every entry of the profile has different meanings, which are thus not <em>homogeneous</em>. We can declare each entry as a separate variable as in the example below, but not only does the code become lengthy, the relation between these entries is not properly presented:</p>
					<code>
						var name = 'TY Chen';<br/>
						var age = 39;<br/>
						var affiliation = 'NTHU';<br/>
						...
					</code>
					<p>But imagine an array-like container, in which each position can be given a meaningful label, so we can clearly know which position stores which type of data...and then you're talking about <em>object</em>. An object is defined with a pair of <em>curved brackets</em> <code>{ }</code> (still remember <em>code block</em>?), which include <em class="extra">keys</em> and their <em>values</em>:</p>
					<code>
						var profile = {<br/>
						<code>
							name: 'TY Chen',<br/>
							age: 39,<br/>
							affiliation: 'NTHU',<br/>
							height: 180,<br/>
							weight: 72,<br/>
						</code>
						};
					</code>
					<p>In the above example, each key and its value is separated by a colon <em>:</em>, and the value is followed by a comma <code>,</code> indicating the end of a <em>field</em>, except for the last one. Note that after the second curved bracket <code>}</code>, a semi-colon <code>;</code> is still added since we are dealing with a <em>statement</em> that declares a variable <code>profile</code>. The way a value is accessed from an object is also very straightforward - just add a period <code>.</code> after the name of an object and the key of the target field:</p>
					<code>
						profile.name; // Get the value of the 'name' field<br/>
						profile['name']; // This would work, too
					</code>
					<p>The same logic applies when you need to update the value of a field or <em>insert</em> a new field:</p>
					<code>
						profile.name = 'Tsung-Ying Chen'; // Update an existing field;<br/>
						profile.gender = 'Male'; // Add a new field called 'gender' with a value 'Male'
					</code>
					<p>As with the case of array, there is no constraint on the type of data in each field - it can be a numeric value, a string, an array, and even another object:</p>
					<code>
						var profile = {<br/>
						<code>
							name: 'TY Chen',<br/>
							age: 39,<br/>
							affiliation: 'NTHU',<br/>
							height: 180,<br/>
							weight: 72,<br/>
							contact: {
							<code>
								home: 02-27682149, // Don't call!<br/>
								mobile: [0937149506, 0956771481, 0982982143]
							</code>
							}
						</code>
						};
					</code>
					<p>In the above example, I added another field with a key <code>contact</code> to store my contact info, whose value is also an object with two fields for my <em>fake</em> home number and <em>fake</em> mobile phone numbers. The <code>mobile</code> field has an array of three numeric values for my three <em>fake</em> mobile numbers, which are <em>homogeneous</em>. Now, the entire profile has a very clear, sensible structure, and can be accessed in a meaningful way:</p>
					<code>
						profile.contact.home; // Get the home number<br/>
						profile.contact.mobile[0]; // Get the first mobile number
					</code>
					<p>Now back to the statement we have been using a lot - <code>console.log()</code>; clearly, there's an object named <code>console</code>, which refers to the console tab of the Developer Tools in your Web browser in this case, and it has a field with a key named <code>log</code>, which is a <em>function</em> represented with a pair of brackets <code>( )</code> that allows you to print some message in the console (again, we will get to the function part soon). Yes, we have been in the world of object <em>since the very beginning of this tutorial!!!</em>. JS is one of the <em>obeject-oriented programming languages</em>, and thus the concept of object is crucial to the rest of this tutorial. In fact, all variables are an object regardless of they are assigned a number, string, or array as their value. For instance, once you declare a <em>string</em> variable, you actually can have access to its <code>length</code> field for the number of characters in this variable:</p>
					<code>
						var str = 'This is a loooooooooooooooog string!';<br/>
						console.log(str.length); // Print the number of characters in "str"
					</code>
					<p>Or, when you have an <em>array</em>, its <code>length</code> field provides you the number of <em>data entries</em> in this array:</p>
					<code>
						var mobileNum = [0937149506, 0956771481, 0982982143];<br/>
						console.log(mobileNum.length); // Get the number of data entries stored in "mobileNum"
					</code>
					<p>You can also <em>add a new entry</em> to the end of an array with the function of the <code>push</code> field of an array object:</p>
					<code>
						mobileNum.push(0976111358); // Insert a new number to the last position of "mobileNum"<br/>
						console.log(mobileNum[3]); // Output = 0976111358
					</code>
					<p>So from now on, when you see a period <code>.</code> in our JS code, you should know that it means two different things - First, it could indicate a decimal in a <em>numeric</em> value as in <em>3.14159</em>, or alternative, it could indicate a field of an object, as in <code>console.log</code>. We will see both cases a lot in the rest of this course.</p>
				</section>
				<section>
					<h2 id="function">Function</h2>
					<p>We rely on functions (or something alike) a lot in all kinds of computer programming since sometimes we need to <em>repeat</em> the same process in our program, so we make the process a function and use it whenever necessary without writing the same codes again and again. A JS function can be created with the following syntax:</p>
					<code>
						function name () {<br/>
						<code>// some statements here</code>
						}
					</code>
					<p>First of all, you need the keyword <code>function</code> to create a JS function, which should be followed by the <em>name</em> of the function. After the function name comes with a pair of brackets <code>( )</code>, which would enclose the data <em class="extra">submitted</em> to the function; in our use of <code>console.log</code>, we always submit the data to the function for it to print out the data. It is nevertheless not required for a function to receive any submitted data, as we will see later. After the brackets, we see a pair of curved brackets <code>{ }</code> that defines a <em class="extra">code block</em> (remember this term?) including some statements. Let's add the following example to our JS file:</p>
					<code>
						function actionCompleted () {
						<code>alert('Completed!');</code>
						}
					</code>
					<p>And when we need to call this newly created function, we just need a statement with the function's name plus a pair of brackets <code>( )</code>. Since we don't need to submit any data to this function, nothing has to be put into <code>( )</code>:</p>
					<code>actionCompleted();</code>
					<p>It doesn't matter whether the statement calling a function occurs before or after the function itself; the <code>function</code> part is always <em class="extra">hoisted</em> to the top of your JS code, too. If we follow the logic discussed earlier about variable declaration, then we should develop a habit to put the function codes to the top of our JS file, because it's natural to think that we create them first and then call them later. However, since you might have many complex functions, their codes are going to be lengthy. Plus, they are not used all the time, and what really matters more is the main code. In this case, putting your function codes to the top of your JS file might be in fact bothersome, because most of the time you just want to debug your main code. So, I'll let you decide which works best for you.</p>
					<p>However, if you declare a variable and assign a function to it with <code>var</code>, this declaration and initialization <em class="extra">won't be hoisted</em> to the top, which means that the statement that calls this function must <em>follow</em> the declaration and initialization codes:</p>
					<code>
						actionCompleted(); // You get an error<br/>
						var actionCompleted = function() { // Declare a variable "actionCompleted" and initialize it with a function
						<code>
							alert('Completed!');
						</code>
						}<br/>
						actionComplete(); // Not a problem
					</code>
					<p>To avoid the above complication, I usually use just go with the <em class="extra">hoisting approach</em>.</p>
					<h3>Data transmitted between functions and their calls</h3>
					<p>Just like <code>console.log</code>, we can create a function that receives data from its calls and do something with that data. In our first example, we create a function that can send whatever message it receives, make some changes, and put it into a pop-up message box:</p>
					<code>
						function popupMsg (msg) {
						<code>
							var finalMsg = 'Site message: ' + msg; // Make some twist<br/>
							alert(finalMsg);
						</code>
						}<br/>
						popupMsg('Test!');<br/>
						popupMsg('Warning!');
					</code>
					<p>In the above example, the function <code>popupMsg</code> is set to receive one data entry, which is given the name <code>msg</code> in this <em>code block</em>. In other words, <code>msg</code> will be the variable name of the data receive by <code>popupMsg</code> <em>only</em> in this function. In <code>popupMsg</code>, I declare another variable <code>finalMsg</code> to store the twist I make for <code>msg</code>. Then, <code>finalMsg</code> is submitted to the <code>alert</code> function to create a pop-up window with the final message in the last statement. After the function code, I call the function twice with two different string values, and two pop-up windows would appear in the order I call the function.</p>
					<p>A function can receive <em>multiple data entries</em>, as long as you separate the names of the variables representing each data entry in the function with a comma <code>,</code> inside <code>( )</code>:</p>
					<code>
						function userMsg (name, msg) {
						<code>
							var finalMsg = name + ' says: ' + msg; // Compose the final msg<br/>
							alert(finalMsg);
						</code>
						}<br/>
						popupMsg('Victor', 'Surprise!');<br/>
						popupMsg('Mary', 'I love Victor!');
					</code>
					<p>To know more about the behavior of a function and a function call, let's assume two possible scenarios. First, you call <code>popupMsg</code>, but nothing is submitted to the function. What would happen?</p>
					<code>popupMsg(); // Call the function without submitting the required data entry</code>
					<p>Second, supposed that you rename <code>userMsg</code> as <code>popupMsg</code>, making it two functions with the same name, but requesting different numbers of data entries. What would happen when you run the two following lines?</p>
					<code>
						popupMsg('Test!');<br/>
						popupMsg('Victor', 'Hey!');
					</code>
					<p>Since you can submit some data to a fuction, a function can also return some data back to where it is called as well, and the keyword is exactly what you expect - <code>return</code>. In the following function <code>complexCalc</code>, it always does a complex calculation based on the two numeric values submitted to it:</p>
					<code>
						function complexCalc (x, y) {
						<code>
							var result = 0; // Declare a variable used to store the result of calculation<br/>
							result = x * y;<br/>
							result = result / (x - y);<br/>
							result = result * y - x;<br/>
							return result; // Return the final outcome
						</code>
						}
					</code>
					<p>Now you can save lots of space without repeating these statements in this function, assuming that you need to do the same calculation for multiple times in your JS codes. But when you call this function, you also need to prepare a variable to store the data the function returns as in the following statement:</p>
					<code>var num = complexCalc(4, 6); // Assign the returned value to a newly declared variable</code>
					<p>One <em>important</em> thing about <code>return</code> is that one a function reach this line, the statements after it won't be executed:</p>
					<code>
						function poorLine () {
						<code>
							var msg = 'test';<br/>
							return msg; // Function stops here<br/>
							alert('Q_Q'); // Not executed
						</code>
						}
					</code>
					<p>Before we leave this section, we can create an object in which each field is a <em>function</em> to mimic the codes like <code>console.log</code>, which calls a function in an object:</p>
					<code>
						var demoFuncs = {
						<code>
							popupMsg: popupMsg, // Key name before the colon, function name after the colon<br/>
							userMsg: userMsg,<br/>
							complexCalc: complexCalc
						</code>
						};
					</code>
					<p>In the <code>demoFuncs</code> object, similar functions are grouped together since they are all some kind of demos. Then, we can call the corresponding function by referring to the specific field in the object, just like <code>console.log</code>:</p>
					<code>demoFuncs.userMsg('Victor', 'I am calling a function!');</code>
					<p>Knowing how to create functions helps you save your effort in coding repeating processes, and knowing how to link a function to a field of an object helps you understand the nature of <em class="extra">object-oriented programming</em>.</p>

					<h2 id="interface">Accessing an HTML document</h2>

					</picture>
					<p>After telling you how object-oriented programming in JS works, I am now able to explain the <em>interface</em> between JS and an HTML document. In JS, we can communicate with our Web browser via the object <code>window</code>. Evidently, this object refers to the browser window, which includes many fields that are directly linked to different parts of a Web browser. For instance, we can get the <em class="extra">viewport</em> width and height by accessing to the <code>innerWidth</code> and <code>innerHeight</code> property of <code>window</code>:</p>
					<code>
						var winWidth = window.innerWidth; // Viewport width in pixel, numeric value<br/>
						var winHeight = window.innerHeight; // Viewport height<br/>
						console.log(winWidth);<br/>
						console.log(winHeight);
					</code>
					<p>Or, you can get the URL of the current page with <code>window.location.href</code> or the path of the current page with <code>window.location.pathname</code>. You can also assign a new value to these properties, which controls a Web browser to navigate to a different website or a different path of the current website:</p>
					<code>
						window.location.href = 'https://google.com'; // Change the current URL to Google<br/>
						window.location.pathname = '/nosuchpath'; // Change to a path that does not exit
					</code>
					<p>We can also run some functions depending on the action executed in a browser window, such as popping up a message when a webpage is fully loaded in the browser window:</p>
					<code>
						window.onload = function() { // Initialized a function in the "onload" field of "window"
						<code>
							alert('Website is ready!'); // Executed when everything in the webpage is fully loaded
						</code>
						};
					</code>
					<h3>Window.document</h3>
					<p>There are many properties or functions that you can take advantage of (see the full list on this <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Window" target="blank">MDN Web Docs page</a>), but our focus in this section will be mostly on <code>window.document</code>, which apparently refers to the HTML document that is currently presented in a Web browser. Since hardly anyone writes JS codes without using <code>window.document</code>, JS developers decided to create a <em>shortcut</em> for it, so you can simply use <code>document</code> for <code>window.document</code>. In <code>document</code>, you can have access to the <em>DOM</em> of an HTML document, such as the title of the website specified inside <code>&lt;title&gt;&lt;/title&gt;</code>:</p>
					<code>
						var siteTitle = document.title;<br/>
						console.log(siteTitle);
					</code>
					<p>Since <code>document</code> allows JS codes to go through the DOM of an HTML document, it is certianly possible for us to retrieve some HTML elements from the DOM, with the functions like <code>getElement<em>s</em>ByTagName</code>, <code>getElement<em>s</em>ByClassName</code>, and <code>getElementById</code>. Note the emphasis put on the plural suffix <em>-s</em> of <em>Element</em> in the first two - It implies that the functions could get <em class="extra">one or more</em> HTML elements from an HTML documents. Let's start with <code>getElementsByTagName</code>, which retrieve all the elements with the same tag name for you:</p>
					<code>
						var allDivs = document.getElementsByTagName('div'); // Assign all "div" elements returned as an array to "allDivs"<br/>
						console.log(allDivs[0]); // Examine the first "div" element as an object in the console tab<br/>
						var allAudios = document.getElementsByTagName('audio'); // Assign all "audio" elements returned as an array to "allAudios"<br/>
						console.log(allAudios); // Probably "null" - nothing
					</code>
					<p>In the above example, we first use <code>getElementsByTagName</code> to retrieve all <code>&lt;div&gt;</code> elements. Since your HTML document is likely to have one or more <code>&lt;div&gt;</code> elements, each element would be collected as an object and stored in an <em>array</em> and finally returned to where <code>getElementsByTagName</code> is called. This is true even if there is only <em>one</em> element, which is stored in an array with just this element. If the function finds nothing in an HTML document, it returns a <code>null</code> value, which represents the absolute <em>emptiness</em> in the word of computer programming.</p>
					<p>The other two functions trawl through an HTML document for elements that are given some specific <code>class</code> and <code>id</code> value, as their name suggests. As briefly discussed earlier, you could <em>group HTML elements together</em> with the <code>class</code> attribute with the <em>same</em> value, or make them <em>distinct from each other</em> with the <code>id</code> attribute assigned a <em>unique</em> value:</p>
					<code>
						&lt;div class="group1" id="no1"&gt;Group 1 No 1&lt;/div&gt;<br/>
						&lt;div class="group1" id="no2"&gt;Group 1 No 2&lt;/div&gt;<br/>
						&lt;div class="group1" id="no3"&gt;Group 1 No 3&lt;/div&gt;<br/>
						&lt;div class="group2" id="no4"&gt;Group 2 No 4&lt;/div&gt;<br/>
						&lt;div class="group2" id="no5"&gt;Group 2 No 5&lt;/div&gt;<br/>
						&lt;div class="group2" id="no6"&gt;Group 2 No 6&lt;/div&gt;
					</code>
					<p>With the six <code>&lt;div&gt;</code> elements in our HTML document, we could try out <code>getElementsByClassName</code> and <code>getElementById</code> respectively. For a specific element object, we could use the property <code>innerHTML</code> to retrieve its content:</p>
					<code>
						var allGroupEm = document.getElementsByClassName('group1'); // Get all "group1" class elements<br/>
						var groupEm = allGroupEm[0]; // Get the first element of the "group1" class<br/>
						console.log(groupEm.innerHTML); // Print the content in the console<br/>
						var idEm = document.getElementById('no6'); // Get <em>one</em> 'no6' id element<br/>
						console.log(idEm.innerHTML); // Print the content
					</code>
					<p>To be able to retrieve the content of these elements means we can also change the content of these elements by assigning a different value to their <code>innerHTML</code> property:</p>
					<code>
						var idEm = document.getElementById('no5'); // Get <em>one</em> 'no5' id element<br/>
						idEm.innerHTML = 'Group 2 No 5 (Changed)'; // Change the content of the element
					</code>
					<h3>JS styling</h3>
					<p>Not only can we change the content of an element, we can also style a particular element in JS, which is probably the most important thing in Web design. For each element object, there is a field named <code>style</code>...and it's clear what it does, right? In this field, you can find and set CSS properties with their name, such as:</p>
					<code>
						idEm.style.color = 'red'; // Set the font color
					</code>
					<p>For CSS properties that originally have a hyphen in their name, such as <code>background-color</code>, you need to remove the hyphen and captalize the first letter of the second word, such as <code>backgroundColor</code> in order to set these CSS properties:</p>
					<code>
						var anotherIdEm = document.getElementById('no6'); // Get <em>one</em> 'no6' id element<br/>
						anotherIdEm.style.backgroundColor = 'red';
					</code>
					<p>What if you need to set <em>multiple</em> CSS properties? Well, you can have one statement for each CSS property, but more easily, you can set them all at once with the <code>cssText</code> property of the <code>style</code> field, in which you put in CSS properties as in the CSS file:</p>
					<code>
						var oneMoreIdEm = document.getElementById('no2'); // Get <em>one</em> 'no2' id element<br/>
						// Set CSS properties one by one<br/>
						oneMoreIdEm.style.backgroundColor = 'red';<br/>
						oneMoreIdEm.style.color = 'white';<br/>
						oneMoreIdEm = document.getElementById('no3'); // Get <em>one</em> 'no3' id element<br/>
						// Set CSS properties all at once<br/>
						oneMoreIdEm.style.cssText = 'background-color: green; color: yellow;';
					</code>
					<p>Since the styles set in JS are viewed as <em>inline styles</em>, they would be <em class="extra">more specific</em> than the styles set in a CSS file for the target elements when same CSS properties are involved. This make sense because you can have some <em>default</em> styles for some elements, whose properties are changed by JS in some contexts.</p>
					<p>You can also set <em>inline styles</em> with the function <code>setAttribute()</code> for an element object, as demonstrated on this <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/ElementCSSInlineStyle/style" target="blank">MDN Web Docs page</a>, but I won't go through it here.</p>
					<h3>Query selector</h3>
					<p>You are now probably very excited, because it's so convenient to refer to the <code>class</code> and <code>id</code> attributes when you need to set the style for a specific element, so you start to think about grouping elements together or making them distinct from each other with these attributes. That's the first mistake I made as an amateur Web designer - I used <em>semantically-free</em> <code>&lt;div&gt;</code> only, and gave them different <code>class</code> and <code>id</code> attribute value so I could locate them in my JS codes very easily. But as I said in the previous unit, this is not the best practice. When you use <em>semantically meaningful</em> elements and have a clear structure for your HTML document, you shouldn't need the <code>class</code> and <code>id</code> attributes most of the time. For example, the <code>&lt;p&gt;</code> elements inside <code>&lt;article&gt;</code> and <code>&lt;section&gt;</code> in the following example might represent different types of information in your webpage. But you don't need different <code>id</code> values for the two paragraphs, because you can use different <em class="extra">selectors</em> to refer to each paragraph: <code>article > p</code> and <code>section > p</code>.</p>
					<code>
						&lt;article&gt;<br/>
						<code>
							&lt;p&gt;<br/>
							&lt;/p&gt;
						</code>
						&lt;/article&gt;<br/>
						&lt;section&gt;
						<code>
							&lt;p&gt;<br/>
							&lt;/p&gt;
						</code>
						&lt;/section&gt;
					</code>
					<p>In JS, you can use the <code>querySelector()</code> function to retrieve an element or the <code>querySelectorAll()</code> to retrieve all elements with a selector and set their styles accordingly, such as:</p>
					<code>
						var em = document.querySelector('section > p'); // Get the first 'p' element whose parent node is 'section'<br/>
						em.style.color = 'white'; // Set the font color of the first element as 'white'
					</code>
					<p>One <em>potential setback</em> in the use of <code>querySelector()</code> or <code>querySelectorAll()</code> is that it's going to be a bit slower than other functions like <code>getElementById()</code>. So, if what you want to do is really to search for elements by their <code>id</code> attribute, for instance, just use <code>getElementById()</code>. But it's definitely not fatal if you use <code>querySelector()</code> or <code>querySelectorAll()</code> to do a complex search - One would feel something only if they use some outdated computers or Web browsers or you use too many <code>querySelector()</code> for too many complicated queries.</p>
					<p>This is also not saying that adding the <code>class</code> or <code>id</code> attribute is a taboo in Web design, or they would have been abandoned for a very long time. For me, I add these attributes in two cases.</p>
					<p>First, CSS selector can't do any further for me. You can see two different types of text emphasis in my webpage, such as <em>this</em> and <em class="extra">this</em>. For both types, I use the semantically meaningful element <code>&lt;em&gt;</code>, but since both types could be used inside a <code>&lt;p&gt;</code> element, selector is not helpful, and I have to add a <code>class</code> attribute to the type I need to highlight a bit more.</p>
					<p>Second, a <code>class</code> or <code>id</code> value is semantically straightforward than a selector. Imaging that you have two buttons in your webpage. One changes the background color of all <code>&lt;div&gt;</code> elements, and the other resets the color. Wouldn't it make more sense to give these two buttons some <code>id</code> attribute specified with <em>changeAll</em> and <em>resetAll</em> respectively? If you use selector, it might be something like <q>the first button in a paragraph</q> and <q>the last button in a paragraph</q>, which is not as semantically transparent as the <code>id</code> attribute.</p>
					<p>So it all comes down to how to save your effort in your Web design project by minimizing and simplifying your codes.</p>

				<section>
					<h2 id="event">Event and interaction</h2>
					<picture>
						<img src="img/cats.gif"/>
					</picture>
					<p>So far the role of our JS codes is pretty <em>active</em> - they are executed automatically after the webpage is fully loaded. But then there's no <em>interaction</em>! What we're hoping for is that there are some elements that could trigger some JS codes when the users do something to them - an <em class="extra">interactive</em> Web interface. To have an interaction, you need to start an <em>event</em>, and receive some <em>feedback</em> from the <em>event target</em>. If you and your friend just sit next to each other, then there's no interaction. If you poke your friend, and s/he has no response at all, then there's no interaction. If you poke you friend, and s/he screems at you, then there's an interaction, although probably not a good one.</p>
					<p>With the <em class="extra">EventHandler</em> in JS, you can set an element in an HTML document to <em>listen to</em> the following events and react accordingly (see this <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Document" target="blank">MDN Web Docs page</a> for a full list):</p>
					<ul>
						<li><code>scroll</code> - when you scroll</li>
						<li><code>keydown</code> - when you press down any key</li>
						<li><code>keyup</code> - when you release a key</li>
						<li><code>click</code> - when you click a mouse key</li>
						<li><code>mousedown</code> - when you click down a mouse key</li>
						<li><code>mouseup</code> - when you release a mouse key</li>
						<li><code>mouseover</code> - when you move a mouse cursor over the target</li>
						<li><code>mouseenter</code> - when you move a mouse cursor into the target</li>
						<li><code>mouseleave</code> - when you move a mouse cursor out of the target</li>
						<li><code>touchstart</code> - when you touch one our more points on the surface</li>
						<li><code>touchend</code> - when you remove one or more touch points from the surface</li>
					</ul>
					<p>The <em>listener</em> of a JS event could be added to an element with the <code>addEventListener()</code> function of an element object, in which you need to specify the event the element listens to and the action taken in JS specified in the <em>listener</em>, which is essentially a function (but see this <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/EventTarget/addEventListener" target="blank">MDN Web Doc page</a> for some complications):</p>
					<code>
						var em = document.querySelector('body'); // Get the 'body' element<br/>
						em.addEventListener('click', function() { // A function triggered upon a 'click' event
						<code>
							alert('clicked!');
						</code>
						}); // It's a statement, so add a semi-colon at the end
					</code>
					<p>If you have different elements that are linked to the same listener, you can create the listener function separately so it can be used in every <code>addEventListener()</code> function:</p>
					<code>
						function clickedMsg() {
							<code>alert('clicked!');</code>
						}<br/>
						var em = document.querySelector('body');<br/>
						em.addEventListener('click', clickedMsg);
					</code>
					<p>It is also possible to add multiple event listeners to the same element:</p>
					<code>
						function enteredMsg() {
							<code>
								alert('mouse entered!');
							</code>
						}<br/>
						em.addEventListener('mouseenter', enteredMsg);
					</code>
