					<p>For many people new to this area, <em>computer programming</em> sounds pretty scary. But Web programming is actually <em class="extra">a lot easier</em> than other types of computer programming (quantum computing? Gee...). JavaScript is also very straightforward, and with the foundation you have built in previous tutorials, you should be able to adapt to it very quickly...let along the fact that people have created a more convenient version of JavaScript - jQuery - which you will learn in the next unit.</p>
					<p>Let's begin with some preparation works. First of all, create a <em class="extra">js</em> directory right under the <em>root</em> directory (namely, <em>/js</em>), which should include global JavaScript (henceforth, JS) files for your entire website. You can create different <em>js</em> directory for each website project in their sub-directory, but we will write some demo codes in the <em>/js</em> directory first.</p>
					<p>Let's first create a <em class="extra">demo.js</em> file in the <em>/js</em> directory. To allow your webpage to run the JS codes in demo.js, we need to load it to your webpage using the <code>&lt;script&gt;</code> element. Insert the following line to your <code>&lt;head&gt;</code> section of your <em>index.html</em> under your <em>root</em> directory, assuming that you did what I said above:</p>
					<p><code>&lt;script src="/js/demo.js"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;</code></p>
					<p>To check if the JS file is embedded correctly into the webpage, add the following line to your <em>demo.js</em>:</p>
					<p><code>alert('embedded!');</code></p>
					<p>After you update your website and reload the index page, you should be able to see a pop-up message showing the message <em class="extra">embedded!</em>.</p>
					<p>And let's go back again to the useful <em class="extra">Developer Tools</em> hidden in your Web browser, and this time look at the <em class="extra">Console</em> tab:</p>

					</picture>
					<p>When we try to <em class="extra">debug</em> your JS codes, you will be using this part of the tools a lot. I mean, <em>A LOT</em>. Let's see how it works. Now, add the following line to your <em>demo.js</em>:</p>
					<p><code>console.log('logged!');</code></p>
					<p>Again, update your website and reload the index page - in addition to the same pop-up message, you should see the new message in the Console tab of your Developer Tools.</p>
					<p>If everything goes as expected, then you are ready for your journey of JS programming!</p>
				</section>

					<h2 id="jssyntax">JavaScript syntax, a breakdown</h2>
					<p>The codes you will see in a JS file could be in general categorized into two types - <em class="extra">statement</em> and <em class="extra">code blocks</em>. We have seen some <em>statements</em> when we were preparing for our JS programming above, one of which is repeated here:</p>
					<p><code>alert('embedded!');</code></p>
					<p>This is a simplified statement that will be translated in an order by a Web browser as <q>show a pop-up message 'embedded!' in the browser window!</q>. The most important thing about a statement in a JS file is that it ends with a <em class="extra">semi-colon</em> <code>;</code>, which indicates <em>the end</em> of a statement. Interestingly, if you remove the semi-colon from the statement above, you'll still see the pop-up message. This does not suggest that the semi-colon is not important - it's just that your Web browser is smart enough to ignore the mistake you make.</p>
					<p>A good example showing the importance of semi-colon in a statement is to put the two statements we used above in the same line as:</p>
					<p><code>alert('embedded!'); console.log('logged!');</code></p>
					<p>Not only will you see the same pop-up message again, you will also see the text message in the console tab of your Developer Tools. This means that statements are processed based on the ending indicated by semi-colons, rather than by separate lines - of course, we still put individual statements in separate lines for <em>a better readibility</em>. So, <em>always</em> add a semi-colons at the end of a statement.</p>
					<p>A <em>code block</em> is just a collection of statements represented with a pair of curved brackets <code>{ }</code>. We have seen the adoption of this concept in the CSS tutorials, in which curved brackets include a collection of CSS properties, and we will extend this concept to <em>objects</em> when we get to <a href="#variable">Variable</a> part. In the following example, we have a code block containing the two statements introduced previously:</p>
					<table>
						<tbody>
							<tr>
								<td>{</td><td></td>
							</tr>
							<tr>
								<td></td><td>alert('embedded!');</td>
							</tr>
							<tr>
								<td></td><td>console.log('logged!');</td>
							</tr>
							<tr>
								<td>}</td><td></td>
							</tr>
						</tbody>
					</table>
