					<p>For many people new to this area, <em>computer programming</em> sounds pretty scary. But Web programming is actually <em class="extra">a lot easier</em> than other types of computer programming (quantum computing? Gee...). JavaScript is also very straightforward, and with the foundation you have built in previous tutorials, you should be able to adapt to it very quickly...let along the fact that people have created a more convenient version of JavaScript - jQuery - which you will learn in the next unit.</p>
					<p>Let's begin with some preparation works. First of all, create a <em class="extra">js</em> directory right under the <em>root</em> directory (namely, <em>/js</em>), which should include global JavaScript (henceforth, JS) files for your entire website. You can create different <em>js</em> directory for each website project in their sub-directory, but we will write some demo codes in the <em>/js</em> directory first.</p>
					<p>Let's first create a <em class="extra">demo.js</em> file in the <em>/js</em> directory. To allow your webpage to run the JS codes in demo.js, we need to load it to your webpage using the <code>&lt;script&gt;</code> element. Insert the following line to your <code>&lt;head&gt;</code> section of your <em>index.html</em> under your <em>root</em> directory, assuming that you did what I said above:</p>
					<p><code>&lt;script src="/js/demo.js"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;</code></p>
					<p>To check if the JS file is embedded correctly into the webpage, add the following line to your <em>demo.js</em>:</p>
					<p><code>alert('embedded!');</code></p>
					<p>After you update your website and reload the index page, you should be able to see a pop-up message showing the message <em class="extra">embedded!</em>.</p>
					<p>And let's go back again to the useful <em class="extra">Developer Tools</em> hidden in your Web browser, and this time look at the <em class="extra">Console</em> tab:</p>
					<picture>

					</picture>
					<p>When we try to <em class="extra">debug</em> your JS codes, you will be using this part of the tools a lot. I mean, <em>A LOT</em>. Let's see how it works. Now, add the following line to your <em>demo.js</em>:</p>
					<p><code>console.log('logged!');</code></p>
					<p>Again, update your website and reload the index page - in addition to the same pop-up message, you should see the new message in the Console tab of your Developer Tools.</p>
					<p>If everything goes as expected, then you are ready for your journey of JS programming!</p>
				</section>
				<section>
					<h2 id="jssyntax">JavaScript syntax, a breakdown</h2>
					<p>The codes you will see in a JS file could be in general categorized into two types - <em class="extra">statement</em> and <em class="extra">code blocks</em>. We have seen some <em>statements</em> when we were preparing for our JS programming above, one of which is repeated here:</p>
					<p><code>alert('embedded!');</code></p>
					<p>This is a simplified statement that will be translated in an order by a Web browser as <q>show a pop-up message 'embedded!' in the browser window!</q>. The most important thing about a statement in a JS file is that it ends with a <em class="extra">semi-colon</em> <code>;</code>, which indicates <em>the end</em> of a statement. Interestingly, if you remove the semi-colon from the statement above, you'll still see the pop-up message. This does not suggest that the semi-colon is not important - it's just that your Web browser is smart enough to ignore the mistake you make.</p>
					<p>A good example showing the importance of semi-colon in a statement is to put the two statements we used above in the same line as:</p>
					<p><code>alert('embedded!'); console.log('logged!');</code></p>
					<p>Not only will you see the same pop-up message again, you will also see the text message in the console tab of your Developer Tools. This means that statements are processed based on the ending indicated by semi-colons, rather than by separate lines - of course, we still put individual statements in separate lines for <em>a better readibility</em>. So, <em>always</em> add a semi-colons at the end of a statement.</p>
					<p>A <em>code block</em> is just a collection of statements represented with a pair of curved brackets <code>{ }</code>. We have seen the adoption of this concept in the CSS tutorials, in which curved brackets include a collection of CSS properties, and we will extend this concept to <em>objects</em> when we get to <a href="#variable">Variable</a> part. In the following example, we have a code block containing the two statements introduced previously:</p>
					<table>
						<tbody>
							<tr>
								<td>{</td><td></td>
							</tr>
							<tr>
								<td></td><td>alert('embedded!');</td>
							</tr>
							<tr>
								<td></td><td>console.log('logged!');</td>
							</tr>
							<tr>
								<td>}</td><td></td>
							</tr>
						</tbody>
					</table>
					<p>We need to use code blocks from time to time in special occassions: Repeat the same statements for multiple times (see <a href="#loop">Loop</a>), run different sets of statements  when different conditions are met (see <a href="#ifelse">If...else...</a>), etc. So code block is just very convenient for programmers. Again, the tradition is to have each statement <em class="extra">indented from the left edge</em> when it is included in a code block to better show where it belongs, and this is why a good editor like Sublime Text also does this for you automatically in a JS file. If you align all statements to the left edge, it won't matter; the statements will still be processed normally by Web browsers. It just creates a mess for you (and your partners in a collaborative project).</p>
					<p>The most frequent type of statements you probably will write and see would involve some <em>operator</em> <code>=</code>, as in the following line:</p>
					<p><code>num = 5;</code></p>
					<p>This <code>= (equal)</code> operator assigns the value to its right (<em>5</em>) to a container named <em>num</em> to its left. More details about this process will be given in the <a href="#variable">Variable</a> section below, but my point here is to bring up another <em>tradition</em> in coding that is not specific to JS. That is, when there's an operator in a statement, we tend to leave a space on both sides of it, again for a <em>better readibility</em> of your codes. You can remove the spaces and will find the processing of your codes unaffected, but it's not as clear in your text editor.</p>
					<p>Finally, as in the case of HTML and CSS, you can also add some notes in your JS file using <code>//</code> or <code>/**/</code>. By adding <code>//</code> before some texts in a JS file, the texts after <code>//</code> in the same line are treated as a <em>comment</em>, rather than part of JS codes:</p>
					<p><code>// This is a comment!</code></p>
					<p>We also frequently use <code>//</code> to <em>temporarily</em> comment out a statement when debugging our codes:</p>
					<p><code>//No more pop-up message!</code></p>
					<p><code>//alert('embedded!'); </code></p>
					<p><code>console.log('logged!');</code></p>

					<p>When you do grocery shopping, you don't go back and forth between shelves and the casher. Instead, you get a basket or a cart with you. You grab goods on the shelves and put them into your basket/cart. Later, you would simply check your container to see the number of things there, and you don't have to go back to every corner in the grocery store to count how many times you grab things from the shelves. Of course, you could change the things in your container freely, but still, you only need to count the number of things in that container.</p>
					<p>All programming languagues have such a container for storing information, from which you can re-use the information easily - it's called <em class="extra">variable</em>. In JS, you can use the keyword <code>var</code> to declare a variable, as in the following example:</p>
					<p><code>var num; // Declare a variable named "num"</code></p>
					<p>And we can put things into the container (I mean, variable) with the <code>=</code> operator introduced in the previous section:</p>
					<p><code>var num = 5; // Declare a variable named "num" equal to a numeric value of 5</code></p>
					<p>It's also possible to declare a variable first without assigning its value, mostly because the value will be assigned in other statements later. In this case, the variable has a <code>null</code> value, since there's nothing in it:</p>
					<p><code>var nullVar; /* This variable has a "null" value */</code></p>
					<p>Let's try to print the value of both variables in the console tab of our Developer Tools to verify my claims:</p>
					<p><code>console.log(num); /* Print the value of "num" */</code></p>
					<p><code>console.log(nullVar); /* Print the value of "nullVar" */ </code></p>
					<h3>The sense/rules of variable naming</h3>
					<p>When you declare a variable, it is also important give your variable a semantically meaningful name. In the above example, my first variable is named <code>num</code> because...it's assigned a numeric value. The second one is <code>nullVar</code> because it is not assigned any value. This logic is similar to those applied to the use of HTML elements - to be <em class="extra">semantically meaningful</em>. No one would stop you using random variable names like x, y, z, etc., but later you would have a hard time recalling the meaning of these variables. In addition to the above guideline, there are some more rules that you must be aware of before moving on:</p>
					<ul>
						<li><em>A variable name cannot include any space</em>, so when I need to combine multiple words for a meaningful variable name, I always capitalize the first letter of a word in the name to make it more readible, just like the <code>nullVar</code> variable above.</li>
						<li><em>A variable name cannot start with a digit letter</em>, so a variable name like <code>1stVar</code> won't work.</li>
						<li><em>Most symbols are reserved for special use</em>, like the operators <code>=</code>, <code>+</code>, etc. The best way to avoid this problem is not to have any symbol in your variable name.</li>
						<li><em>There is also a list of reserved words</em>, like the <code>var</code> keyword, which cannot be used as a variable name. See a complete list on this <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/js/js_reserved.asp" target="blank">W3CSchool page</a>.</li>
					</ul>
					<p>Interestingly, you can use weird Unicode characters in your variable name, like <em>ಠ_ಠ</em>:</p>
					<p><code>var ಠ_ಠ; /* Declare a weird variable name */ </code></p>
					<p><code>console.log(ಠ_ಠ); /* You should get "null" */</code></p>
					<p>I would suggest no one to include any special Unicode characters in your variable names - imagine how emoticons could annoy other people trying to read your codes, for instance. Just use the regular English alphabet. If you have any conern over your variable names, you can check their validity on <a href="https://mothereff.in/js-variables" target="blank">this page</a>.</p>
					<p>Lastly, I would like to remind you that everything in JS are <em class="extra">case-sensitive</em>:</p>
					<p><code>var num = 5;</code></p>
					<p><code>var Num = 10;</code></p>
					<p><code>console.log(num); // It's impossible to be 10</code></p>
					<p><code>console.log(Num); // It's impossible to be 5</code></p>
					<h3>Number, string, and operators</h3>
					<p>In the above examples, we see how to assign a value to a variable via the operator <code>=</code>, but the assigned value could also be the result of some mathematical calculations using the operators <code>+</code>, <code>-</code>, <code>*</code> (multiply), and <code>/</code> (divide), as in the following cases:</p>
					<p><code>var math1 = 2 + 5;</code></p>
					<p><code>var math2 = 3 * 4.5;</code></p>
					<p><code>var math3 = 1 - 5 * 40;</code></p>
					<p>Crucially, your formula can include other variables that are assigned a value <em class="extra">earlier</em>:</p>
					<p><code>var num = 5;</code></p>
					<p><code>var newNum = 4 + num;</code></p>
					<p>So far, the focus has been on variables that are assigned a numeric value, but of course we have many different types of data that can be stored into a variable. The data type we will be using a lot in JS, especially when we need to make our webpages interactive, is <em class="extra">string</em>. In JS, a string must be enclosed inside a pair of single/double quotation marks, as in the following example:</p>
					<p><code>var stringVar = 'Here is a string!';</code></p>
					<p>Whether you use single or double quotation marks doesn't really matter, as long as you are <em>consistent</em>. You can't have a single quotation mark on the one side but a double quotation mark on the other:</p>
					<p><code>var wrongStringVar = <em>'</em>This will not work!<em>"</em>; /* You will see some error message in the console */</code></p>
					<p>I prefer to use <em>single</em> quotation mark just because it's easier to type (you need <em>shift + '</em> to get a double quotation mark). Yes, I'm just a lazybone. The only minor issue that you might encounter is when your string also has some single quotation marks. In this case, you need to add a <em class="extra">backslash</em> <code>\</code> before each special symbol to <em>escape</em> the character (namely, to tell a Web browser that this single quotation mark should be treated as a regular character, not a special symbol):</p>
					<p><code>var stringWithQuote = 'Here<em>\</em>'s a single quotation mark!';</code></p>
					<p>In JS, you could also easily combine numeric and string values as a <em>string</em> using the <code>+</code> operator:</p>
					<p><code>console.log('A number: '+5); // Output = 'A number 5';</code></p>
					<p><code>var num = 5;</code></p>
					<p><code>var str = 'A number ';</code></p>
					<p><code>console.log(str+num); // The output is the same;</code></p>
					<p>Let's have a small test here - what is the value of the two variables <code>test1</code> and <code>test2</code> below?</p>
					<p><code>var test1 = 'Value: ' + 5 + 10;</code></p>
					<p><code>var test2 = 'Value: ' + 5 * 10;</code></p>
					<p>Of course, it is not possible to use other operators for numeric and string values:</p>
					<p><code>var wrongVar = 'Value ' * 5; // What is this supposed to mean anyway?</code></p>
					<p><code>var cantDoThis = 'Get rid of A' - 'A'; // Nope. You can't take out a string in this way.</code></p>
