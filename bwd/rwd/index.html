					<p>The world is changing, and so is Web Design. There are just so many digital devices coming out each year, and they all get a different screen resolution, and a notable difference driven by this revolutionary progress is the contrast between the <em class="extra">portrait view</em> and the <em class="extra">landscape view</em>. In the former, the screen width is longer than the screen height, whereas it is the other way around in the latter. If your websites are designed to be best viewed with the portrait view, then its layout will inevitably a mess in the portrait view. Since this course website is not designed specifically to be viewed in the portrait mode, it won't look decent in your smart phone, albeit not a total disater.</p>
					<p>This is why you need to make your websites <em class="extra">responsive</em> to different screen resolutions, so when somebody interested in you and check your websites with their mobile devices, they don't feel frustrated and instead recognize you as a professional Web designer.</p>

					<p>The first step in making your websites responsive is to tell Web browsers that your websites are responsive with the <em class="extra">metadata</em> added to <code>&lt;head&gt;</code> below.</p>
					<code>
						&lt;meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"&gt;
					</code>
					<p>In this <code>meta</code> element, we first include <code>name="viewport"</code> to tell <em class="extra">mobile browsers</em> to refer to a specific initial size of the <em class="extra">viewport</em> (that is, the visible area of Web contents). Why? When a website is not designed to be responsive, the width of an HTML document is almost certainly longer than the width of a mobile device in its portrait view. A mobile Web browser may thus use a <em>virtual viewport</em> to shrink the webpage and render the shrinked version to the <em>actual viewport</em>. Since a virtual viewport is always used by a mobile browser, it is not possible for a webpage to use a different layout based on a different device width. Setting <code>name="viewport"</code> stops a mobile Web browser from using a virtual viewport in all cases and allows the browser to adopt a designed layout for a viewport smaller a specific size (with recourse to <em>media queries</em>. See below). This is relevant  If you need some more explanations, see <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Mozilla/Mobile/Viewport_meta_tag" target="_blank">this page in MDN Web Docs</a></p>
