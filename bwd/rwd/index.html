					<p>The world is changing, and so is Web Design. There are just so many digital devices coming out each year, and they all get a different screen resolution, and a notable difference driven by this revolutionary progress is the contrast between the <em class="extra">portrait view</em> and the <em class="extra">landscape view</em>. In the former, the screen width is longer than the screen height, whereas it is the other way around in the latter. If your websites are designed to be best viewed with the portrait view, then its layout will inevitably a mess in the portrait view. Since this course website is not designed specifically to be viewed in the portrait mode, it won't look decent in your smart phone, albeit not a total disater.</p>
					<p>This is why you need to make your websites <em class="extra">responsive</em> to different screen resolutions, so when somebody interested in you and check your websites with their mobile devices, they don't feel frustrated and instead recognize you as a professional Web designer.</p>
