					<p>The world is changing, and so is Web Design. There are just so many digital devices coming out each year, and they all get a different screen resolution, and a notable difference driven by this revolutionary progress is the contrast between the <em class="extra">portrait view</em> and the <em class="extra">landscape view</em>. In the former, the screen width is longer than the screen height, whereas it is the other way around in the latter. If your websites are designed to be best viewed with the portrait view, then its layout will inevitably a mess in the portrait view. Since this course website is not designed specifically to be viewed in the portrait mode, it won't look decent in your smart phone, albeit not a total disater.</p>
					<p>This is why you need to make your websites <em class="extra">responsive</em> to different screen resolutions, so when somebody interested in you and check your websites with their mobile devices, they don't feel frustrated and instead recognize you as a professional Web designer.</p>

					<p>The first step in making your websites responsive is to tell Web browsers that your websites are responsive with the <em class="extra">metadata</em> added to <code>&lt;head&gt;</code> below.</p>
					<code>
						&lt;meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"&gt;
					</code>
					<p>In this <code>meta</code> element, we first include <code>name="viewport"</code> to tell <em class="extra">mobile browsers</em> to refer to a specific initial size of the <em class="extra">viewport</em> (that is, the visible area of Web contents). Why? When a website is not designed to be responsive, the width of an HTML document is almost certainly longer than the width of a mobile device in its portrait view. A mobile Web browser may thus use a <em>virtual viewport</em> to shrink the webpage and render the shrinked version to the <em>actual viewport</em>. Since a virtual viewport is always used by a mobile browser, it is not possible for a webpage to use a different layout based on a different device width. Setting <code>name="viewport"</code> stops a mobile Web browser from using a virtual viewport in all cases and allows the browser to adopt a designed layout for a viewport smaller than a specific size (with recourse to <em>media queries</em>. See below). This is relevant to the setting in <code>content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"</code>. In the value of the <code>content</code> attribute, we define two separate <em class="extra">subvalues</em>. The first subvalue <code>width=device-width</code> means that the actual viewport width used by the Web browser varies by the width of different devices. This is the most crucial part in setting up a responsive website since users' devices have all different screen widths as discussed in the previous section. The second subvalue tells the browser to initially scale the viewport size to the original one (1.0 = 100%), so the layout is always adjusted based on the actual viewport width of the device. This line of metadata would work in most responsive website projects, but if you want to know a bit more about this part, see <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Mozilla/Mobile/Viewport_meta_tag" target="_blank">this page in MDN Web Docs</a></p>
					<h3>Media query</h3>
					<p>After you set up the metadata for a responsive webpage properly, you can then define different layout in a CSS file with <em class="extra">media queries</em> using <code>@media</code> rules as in the following example:</p>
					<code>
						@media screen and (max-width: 800px) {
						<code>
							/* some CSS styles */
						</code>
						}
					</code>
					<p>The above example defines a block of CSS styles that applies only when the media, which is set to be the device screen, has a width of 800 pixels at maximum. Following this logic, we can have CSS styles that apply by default except in some cases:</p>
					<code>
						/* Default DIV style */<br/>
						div {
						<code>
							background-color: red;<br/>
							width: 30%;
						</code>
						}<br/>
						@media screen and (max-width: 800px) {
						<code>
							/* DIV style applied in a narrower device */<br/>
							div {
							<code>
								width: 100%;
							</code>
							}
						</code>
						}
					</code>
					<p>In this example, the width of a <code>&lt;div&gt;</code> element is by default 30% of the width of its immediate ancestor, but is adjusted into 100% in a device with a screen width of 800 pixels or lower. Since the property <code>background-color</code> is not set to a different value in the block inside the media query, it would remain unchanged and still embellish a <code>&lt;div&gt;</code> element with a red background color.</p>
