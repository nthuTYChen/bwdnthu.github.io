				<h1>HTML Basics</h1>
				<p><em>HyperText Markup Language</em> - that's what HTML stands for. It builds the fundamental structure of a webpage for you, just like the bones in your body.</p>

					<h2>HTML tags</h2>
					<p>Every webpage is composed of a bunch of HTML tags <em>translated</em> by your Web browser properly into the layout you see on a computer screen.</p>
					<p>An HTML tag is like <code>&lt;html&gt;</code>, with the name of the tag enclosed in two angle brackets <code><</code> and <code>></code>. In an HTML file, you usually see two types of HTML tags. One marks up a <em class="extra">scope</em> of contents, which determines how these contents are represented in a webpage; for instance:</p>
					<p><code>&lt;html&gt;some contents&lt;/html&gt;</code></p>
					<p>In the above example, you see the tag representing the beginning of the scope without a slash as well as the tag representing the end of the scope with a slash. The other HTML tag type is itself presented as a <em class="extra">single element</em> in a webpage; for instance:</p>
					<p><code>&lt;br/&gt;</code></p>
					<p>In the above example, you only see one tag that will be interpreted as a <em>line break</em> (thus its "br" name), which ends with a slash.</p>
					<p>You will also see some other markups that are not HTML tags themselves but have some special meanings. For example, we will use <code>&lt;!DOCTYPE&gt;</code> to declare the document type for a webpage, and we also use <code>&lt;!-- --&gt;</code> to add some important notes just for our own reference.</p>
