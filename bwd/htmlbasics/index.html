					<h2>HTML tags</h2>
					<p>Every webpage is composed of a bunch of HTML tags <em>translated</em> by your Web browser properly into the layout you see on a computer screen.</p>
					<p>An HTML tag is like <code>&lt;html&gt;</code>, with the name of the tag enclosed in two angle brackets <code><</code> and <code>></code>. In an HTML file, you usually see two types of HTML tags. One marks up a <em class="extra">scope</em> of contents, which determines how these contents are represented in a webpage; for instance:</p>
					<p><code>&lt;html&gt;some contents&lt;/html&gt;</code></p>
					<p>In the above example, you see the tag representing the beginning of the scope without a slash as well as the tag representing the end of the scope with a slash. The other HTML tag type is itself presented as a <em class="extra">single element</em> in a webpage; for instance:</p>
					<p><code>&lt;br/&gt;</code></p>
					<p>In the above example, you only see one tag that will be interpreted as a <em>line break</em> (thus its "br" name), which ends with a slash.</p>
					<p>You will also see some other markups that are not HTML tags themselves but have some special meanings. For example, we will use <code>&lt;!DOCTYPE&gt;</code> to declare the document type for a webpage, and we also use <code>&lt;!-- Here's some note! --&gt;</code> to add some important notes just for our own reference.</p>

					<h2 id="firstindexhtml">Your first index.html</h2>
					<p>With the above overview, let's take a look at what you must have in your <em class="extra">index.html</em> for your Web browser to parse the structure of a webpage and then present it.</p>

					<p>As noted earlier, you need to tell your Web browser the type of the document it needs to present, we always have <code>&lt;!DOCTYPE&gt;</code> at the beginning of a document. But since we are composing an HTML file, we needs to specifically declare the document as HTML with:</p>
					<p><code>&lt;!DOCTYPE HTML&gt;</code></p>
					<p>Following the declaration of the document type, you would naturally see the <em>scope</em> of the HTML contents, which are enclosed with <code>&lt;html&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</code>.</p>
					<p>Inside <code>&lt;html&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</code>, you then see <code>&lt;head&gt;&lt;/head&gt;</code>, where the <em>metadata</em> is located. The metadata is not part of the webpage itself; you can consider it to be the <em>description</em> of the webpage. That explains why you see <code>&lt;title&gt;&lt;/title&gt;</code> in this section; the title of a webpage is part of its metadata. When we incorporate some external files or codes into the webpage (we'll talk about it later), we put them here as well to make sure they are <em class="extra">loaded first</em>.</p>
					<p>After <code>&lt;/head&gt;</code>, you would see <code>&lt;body&gt;&lt;/body&gt;</code>. This is where the contents that will be presented in a webpage go.</p>

					<h2 id="htmlw3c">HTML and W3C standards</h2>
					<p>The most updated version of HTML is HTML5, which has been developed following the W3C (World Wide Web Consortium) standards. With the standards, same HTML tags should be compatible to different browsers - but you have to be careful! Some older HTML tags might have become <em class="extra">deprecated</em>, while newly HTML tags might be more or less <em class="extra">experimental</em> and are thus not fully supported by all mainstream browsers.</p>
					<p>If you want to use a tag that you have never seen before and it seems useful, check some reliable sources to see if it support the majority of Web browsers, such as <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML" target="blank">MDN web docs.</a> In this course, we will just check our webpage using Google Chrome, but in reality, you should test your webpage in all different kinds of Web browsers.</p>
					<p>In this course, we will try not to go wild, but use some common HTML tags to construct our websites. Neither will I go through old and new <em>browser wars</em> - google it if you're interested.</p>

					<h2 id="addsomespice">Add some spices</h2>
					<p>Now that we understand how HTML tags in our first <em>index.html</em>, we have to make some additional tweaks to optimize the decoding of your HTML document in different Web browsers.</p>
					<p>First, let's change <code>&lt;html&gt;</code> to:</p>
					<p><code>&lt;html lang="en-us"&gt;</code></p>
					<p>In this change, we add the <em class="extra">attribute</em> <em>lang</em> to the <code>&lt;html&gt;</code> tag. An attribute assigns a <em>property</em> to a specific tag for it (or its contents). In the above change, the value <em>en-us</em> of the <em>lang</em> attribute explicitly requires the browser to arrange texts following <em>US English</em>. When your webpage goes bilingual, then the value of this attribute for your Taiwan Mandarin webpages should be <em class="extra">zh-Hant-TW</em> (rather than just zh-tw).</p>
					<p>Next, inside <code>&lt;head&gt;&lt;/head&gt;</code>, let's add the following line after <code>&lt;/head&gt;</code>:</p>
					<p>&lt;meta charset="UTF-8"&gt;</p>
					<p>This <em>meta</em> tag is obviously adding some metadata to our HTML document, and the attribute <em>charset</em> is specified with <em>UTF-8</em>, which tells a Web browser to treat the contents as Unicode texts, so texts could be encoded properly even if they are from different languages. You can't imagine how hard it was to get foreign websites encoded properly 20 years ago. Most of modern Web browsers set UTF-8 encoding as their default, but it doesn't hurt to always have this by default just in case.</p>
