					<h2 id="overview">Overview</h2>
					<p>This is finally the last section in this tutorial, and you have probably waited for this to come since you're really keen to add more spice to your websites. Here I am going to share some basics with you, which would be enough for some non-commercial websites. These tips only takes up a very small portion of the world of Web animation, which is still expanding rapidly. But I hope they will help build a strong foundation for you to learn some more advanced skills, which is what I'm still doing now! I would once again to highlight the risk of an excessively animated website, which will burden a Web browser especially in an old device.</p>

					<p>We can start with the simplest approach, that is, to use the CSS property <code>transition</code> to create some Web animation when there's some interaction that changes an HTML element from one state into a different state. What do I mean by this? You probably have had the answer already - for instance, when the mouse cursor hovers over an HTML element, the element is in the <code>:hover</code> <em class="extra">pseudo-class</em>.</p>
					<p>In our previous unit, we did try to make changes to the style of hovered elements with the pseudo-class, but all the changes were <em>abrupt</em>. With the CSS property <code>transition</code>, we will be able to give some life by making <em class="extra">gradual</em> styling changes. The <code>transition</code> property is in fact a family of CSS properties that allows you to fine-tune the changes between different styles:</p>
					<ul>
						<li><code>transition-property</code> - You can apply a transition to almost all CSS properties, such as <code>width</code>, <code>background-color</code>, and more. If you don't need to separate the transitions of different CSS properties from each other, you can just use the value <code>all</code>. One CSS property that you <em>can't</em> really apply a gradual transition to is <code>display</code> - What does even a gradual transition from <code>block</code> to <code>inline-block</code> mean? I know. You're probably thinking about the gradual transition between <code>none</code> and <code>block</code>, for instance, but we have other approaches to this transition below.</li>
						<li><code>transition-duration</code> - You can also determine how long the transition should be. If you set the value as <code>1s</code>, then the whole transition process will take just one second.</li>
						<li><code>transition-timing-function</code> - By default, you might think of some <code>linear</code> gradual transition. That is, the speed of a transition remains <em>constant</em> from the beginning to the end. However, CSS3 offers you many different options, such as <code>ease-in</code> (slower at the beginning, faster toward the end) and <code>ease-out</code> (faster at the beginning, slower toward the end). A complete list of easing effect can be found <a href="https://easings.net/" target="_blank">here</a>, and you can choose whichever matches the presentation in your mind.</li>
						<li><code>trainsition-delay</code> - By specifying this property with a time in second, you can delay the transition effect. Most of times we won't be using this property, but it can help create a <em>trailing tail</em> for a moving object and keep the end result of a transition bit longer.</li>
					</ul>
					<p>Since all of the above individual properties have a pretty long name, it is indeed more reasonable (if compared to <code>font</code>) to use the shorthand <code>transition</code> and specify the four properties in the same order:</p>
					<code>
						transition: property duration timing-function delay;
					</code>
					<p>Let's do a quick demonstration. Create a <code>&lt;div&gt;</code> in an HTML document and define the element's appearance with the following styles. With these styles, the block element will gradually enlarge when you move your mouse cursor over it, and at the same time the background color will also smoothly change from an orange color to a red color. And the whole process will take one second to complete.</p>
					<code>
						body > div {
						<code>
							position: absolute;<br/>
							top: 50%;<br/>
							left: 50%;<br/>
							transform: translate(-50%, -50%); /* aligned to the center */<br/>
							width: 100px;<br/>
							height: 100px;<br/>
							background-color: orange;
						</code>
						}<br/><br/>
						body > div:hover {
						<code>
							width: 150px;<br/>
							height: 150px;<br/>
							background-color: red;<br/>
							transition: all 1s ease-in;
						</code>
						}
					</code>
					<p>Currently, we only add the transition that takes place when the target <code>&lt;div&gt;</code> element is changed into the <code>:hover</code> pseudo-class, so when you move your mouse cursor away from the element, the style changes back to the default <em class="extra">abruptly</em>. To also make a gradual transition back to the element's default style, we also have to add <code>transition</code> to the default style as well:</p>
					<code>
						body > div {
						<code>
							/* old styles above... */<br/>
							transition: all 1s ease-out; /* use ease-out here to reverse the ease-in effect */
						</code>
					</code>
					<p>Maybe you want the transition to be different for <code>background-color</code> and for <code>width</code> and <code>height</code>. Then, you could separate the transition for <code>background-color</code> from <code>all</code> transitions with a <em class="extra">comma</em> in the <code>transition</code> property:</p>
					<code>
						body > div:hover {
						<code>
							width: 150px;<br/>
							height: 150px;<br/>
							background-color: red;<br/>
							transition: all 1s ease-in, background-color 10s ease-out; /* apply transitions separately */
						</code>
						}
					</code>
					<h3>Catch me if you can</h3>
					<p>As mentioned earlier, it is not really possible to make a transition between <code>none</code> and other values for the <code>display</code> property, supposed that your goal is to make an element appear/disappear gradually. But there are other solutions, too. The first one is to make a gradual transition for the property <code>opacity</code>, and let's try this with the following HTML content, in which a <code>&lt;div&gt;</code> element is enclosed inside another <code>&lt;div&gt;</code> element. Our goal is to create the effect that when the mouse is over the outer <code>&lt;div&gt;</code>, the inner <code>&lt;div&gt;</code> appears gradually next to it.</p>
					<code>
						&lt;div&gt;
						<code>
							&lt;div&gt;Hello!&lt;/div&gt;
						</code>
						&lt;/div&gt;
					</code>
					<p>Below are the default styles for both <code>&lt;div&gt;</code> elements. Crucially, we can see that the inner <code>&lt;div&gt;</code> element is set to have <code>position: absolute;</code> as well, and since its ancestor is also specified with a <em>non-static</em> position, the inner <code>&lt;div&gt;</code> would be positioned with respect to the edges of the outer <code>&lt;div&gt;</code>. Thus, when the inner <code>&lt;div&gt;</code> is set to have <code>left: 100%;</code>, it means that the inner <code>&lt;div&gt;</code> is moved from the <em>left edge of its ancestor</em> by the full width of the ancestor (which is equal to <code>100px</code>). So, although the inner <code>&lt;div&gt;</code> is enclosed inside another <code>&lt;div&gt;</code>, it is moved out by the CSS style in the final presentation.</p>
					<code>
						body > div {
						<code>
							position: absolute;<br/>
							top: 50%;<br/>
							left: 50%;<br/>
							transform: translate(-50%, -50%);<br/>
							width: 100px;<br/>
							height: 100px;<br/>
							background-color: green;
						</code>
						}<br/><br/>
						body > div > div {
						<code>
							position: absolute;<br/>
							left: 100%;<br/>
							width: 100px;<br/>
							height: 100px;<br/>
							background-color: red;<br/>
							color: white;<br/>
							opacity: 0; /* You can't see me, but I'm still here! */
						</code>
						}
					</code>
					<p>Again, to achieve our goal, we have to rely on the pseudo-class <code>:hover</code>. But to which element should we add this pseudo-class in our CSS file? It's the outer <code>&lt;div&gt;</code> - because we want the inner <code>&lt;div&gt;</code> to appear when the mouse cursor hovers over the outer one, that is, to make the outer one belong to the <code>:hover</code> pseudo-class.</p>
					<code>
						body > div:hover > div {
						<code>
							opacity: 1;<br/>
							transition: all 0.3s ease-out;
						</code>
						}
					</code>
					<p>This approach is convenient but you have to be sure that the transparent element doesn't overlap with other clickable contents because the transparent element would be an invisible wall.</p>
					<p>In the second approach, we do not manipulate the opacity but the width (or the height) of the inner <code>&lt;div&gt;</code> element in the transitional process. In our example above, we can start by setting the inner <code>&lt;div&gt;</code> to have a <code>width</code> of <code>0</code> in its default setting, so it is made invisible because it has a zero width! To complete hiding everything in the inner <code>&lt;div&gt;</code>, we would have to add the <code>overflow</code> property and set it as <code>hidden</code>.</p>
					<code>
						body > div > div {
						<code>
							position: absolute;<br/>
							left: 100%;<br/>
							width: 0; /* I'm still here, but too thin to be seen! */ <br/>
							height: 100px;<br/>
							overflow: hidden;<br/>
							background-color: red;<br/>
							color: white;
						</code>
						}
					</code>
					<p>Now, it shouldn't be hard to see how to set the <code>transition</code> property to the style for the hovered outer <code>&lt;div&gt;</code>, right?</p>
					<code>
						body > div:hover > div {
						<code>
							width: 100px; /* I'm still here, but too thin to be seen! */ <br/>
							transition: all 0.3s ease-out;
						</code>
						}
					</code>
