					<h3>Content</h3>
					<ul>
						<li>Do not use give the last name first in your writing, as the comma used to single out your last name would confuse your readers:
							<p>
								<q>Hi, my name is <s>Chen, Tsung-Ying</s>.</q> &#8594; <q>Hi, my name is <em>Tsung-Ying Chen</em>.</q>
							</p>
						</li>
						<li>Please focus more on yourself and what you have done or what you're currently doing, rather than the people around you (e.g., your family). Your autobiography is supposed to show some more professional side of you.</li>
						<li>Following the above suggestions, you should be discrete about being vague in your personal website.</li>
						<li>You need to get the proper names right:
							<p><q><s>Tsinghua University</s></q> &#8594; <q>National Tsing Hua University</q></p>
							<p><q>Foreign <s>Language</s> and Literature</q> &#8594; <q>Foreign <em>Languages</em> and Literature</q></p>
							<p><q><s>carefree club</s></q> &#8594; <q>Carefree Club</q></p>
						</li>
						<li>There is no need to talk about yourself from a third-person perspective.</li>
					</ul>
					<h3>Organization</h3>
					<ul>
						<li>Less is always more
							<p>
								<q>I am currently learning how to write creatively, well, struggling to put my scattered thoughts into a complete paragraph is probably a more precise description. <s>Anyway,</s> words to me are like a refugee or an alternative world for the disturbed, and ultimately a provider of different ways we can view the world.</q>
							</p>
							<p>
								<q>I spent a lot of time trying to become <s>the one who I want to be,</s> a person who outgoing and initiative. </q>
							</p>
							<p>
								<q><s>When I say</s> free time, I mean...</q> &#8594; <q><em>By free time</em>, I mean...</q>
							</p>
							<p>
								<q>After taking the course for a year, I decided to take the job as a course organizer<s>, aka TA</s>, and now this is my second year <s>as a TA in the program</s> <em>in this position</em>.</q>
							</p>
							<p>
								<q>However, I found out that this kind of "interesting and productive" life wasn’t what I wanted. Therefore, I started to spend time on things that I am interested in. I spent time practicing my drawing skills, learning how to edit video clips, and working out to keep myself fit.</q> &#8594; <q><em>However, I found this "interesting" life to be in fact uninteresting, so I followed my heart and shifted my focus. I started to learn drawing and video-editing and work out regularly to get fitter.</em></q>
							</p>
						</li>
						<li>Avoid lengthy statements
							<p>
								<q>In the seminar of Phonetic theory, she gave out her first try in designing a perceptual experiment to testify one of the controversial claims proposed by modern speech perception theories<em>. Deeply attracted by the experimental approach to theory-testing, she then chose</em> the topic for her term project<s>,</s> as well as her future research focus<s>, since she found using experimental design in theory-testing to be really attractive.</s></q>
							</p>
						</li>
						<li>Connect relevant sentences (if the result is not a lengthy sentence)
							<p>
								<q>Hi, I’m Chris, or you can call me Yon-Gjun Hou in Chinese. I was born in Chiayi <em>in a family of five</em><s>. There are five people in my family</s>.</q>
							</p>
						</li>
						<li>Make a proper contrast
							<p>
								<q>The most difficult part in teaching them is to design some games which can help them to remember those words quickly, but <s>for most of the time</s> <em>in the end</em>, I’m <em>always</em> happy to see them learn with joy and have progress.</q>
							</p>
							<p>
								<q><em>Since</em> my father also graduated from the Department of EE<s>. In fact</s>, I was taught and influenced by my father when I was a child, and <s>thus developing</s> <em>developed</em> some interests <s>on</s> <em>in</em> mathematics.</q>
							</p>
							<p>
								<q>Unfortunately, despite receiving an 88.75 on my English test, I wasn’t able to <s>enter</s> <em>be admitted</em> to the department<s>. Nonetheless, I have been enthusiastic</s><em>, but with a strong interest</em> in literature and linguistics; therefore, I <em>still chose to enter</em><s>entered</s> the Department of English Instruction.</q>
							</p>
							<p>
								<q>I’m an extroverted person in private life<s>; however</s>, <em>so</em> there’s no chance <em>of getting to know me</em>, if you <s>w</s><em>d</em>on’t start a conversation. <s>So, d</<em>D</em>on’t be shy <em>and just</em> <s>to start </s>talk<s>ing with</s> <em>to</em> me.</q>
							</p>
						</li>
						<li>Avoid "I"s
							<p>
								<q>I am an independent person because of my growth environment. <s>I live</s> <em>My home is located</em> in the countryside of Taichung <s>where is</s> far from the downtown area <em>which forced me to</em><s>. Therefore, I</s> live<s>d outside</s> by myself <s>when I was in</s> <em>in a house close to my</em> senior high school. It took me little time to practice living alone.</q>
							</p>
						</li>
					</ul>
					<h3>Grammar</h3>
					<p>
						<q>I was born in Taichung, where is also my favorite city <s>due to</s> <em>for</em> the weather.</q>
					</p>
					<p>
						<q><s>Briefly,</s> <em>If I have to</em> use one sentence to describe my personality, <em>It would be</em> "Never regret the consequence of what you did, but regret why you never did."</q>
					</p>
					<p>
						<q>Even <em>?</em>, every time I finish an activity, I will get a great sense of accomplishment.</q>
					</p>
					<p>
						<q>My students are <em>in</em> second and third grade in elementary school.</q>
					</p>
					<p>
						<q>One of my interests is to interact and make friends with people from different groups and <em>with various</em> backgrounds.</q>
					</p>
					<p>
						<q>During my <em>current</em> college life, I <em>have</em> joined several clubs and <s>took</s> <em>taken</em> part in quite many activities.</q>
					</p>
					<p>
						<q>My talent in writing flourished during this period. I won several writing awards in <s>the</s> national and citywide contents.</q>
					</p>
					<p>
						<q>Knowing that I could have learned more made me reconsider whether studying in this department <s>is</s> <em>was</em> the right decision.</q>
