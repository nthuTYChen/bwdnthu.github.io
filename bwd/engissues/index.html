						<li>Do not use give the last name first in your writing, as the comma used to single out your last name would confuse your readers.
							<p>
								<q>Hi, my name is <s>Chen, Tsung-Ying</s>.</q> &#8594; <q>Hi, my name is <em>Tsung-Ying Chen</em>.</q>
							</p>
						</li>
						<li>Please focus more on yourself and what you have done or what you're currently doing, rather than the people around you (e.g., your family). Your autobiography is supposed to show some more professional side of you.</li>
						<li>Following the above suggestions, you should be discrete about being vague in your personal website.</li>
						<li>You need to get the proper names right.
							<p><q><s>Tsinghua University</s></q> &#8594; <q>National Tsing Hua University</q></p>
							<p><q>Foreign <s>Language</s> and Literature</q> &#8594; <q>Foreign <em>Languages</em> and Literature</q></p>
							<p><q><s>carefree club</s></q> &#8594; <q>Carefree Club</q></p>
