						<li>Do not use give the last name first in your writing, as the comma used to single out your last name would confuse your readers:
							<p>
								<q>Hi, my name is <s>Chen, Tsung-Ying</s>.</q> &#8594; <q>Hi, my name is <em>Tsung-Ying Chen</em>.</q>
							</p>
						</li>
						<li>Please focus more on yourself and what you have done or what you're currently doing, rather than the people around you (e.g., your family). Your autobiography is supposed to show some more professional side of you.</li>
						<li>Following the above suggestions, you should be discrete about being vague in your personal website.</li>

							<p><q><s>Tsinghua University</s></q> &#8594; <q>National Tsing Hua University</q></p>
							<p><q>Foreign <s>Language</s> and Literature</q> &#8594; <q>Foreign <em>Languages</em> and Literature</q></p>
							<p><q><s>carefree club</s></q> &#8594; <q>Carefree Club</q></p>
						</li>
						<li>There is no need to talk about yourself from a third-person perspective.</li>
					</ul>

						<li>Less is always more

								<q>I am currently learning how to write creatively, well, struggling to put my scattered thoughts into a complete paragraph is probably a more precise description. <s>Anyway,</s> words to me are like a refugee or an alternative world for the disturbed, and ultimately a provider of different ways we can view the world.</q>

							<p>
								<q>I spent a lot of time trying to become <s>the one who I want to be,</s> a person who outgoing and initiative. </q>

								<q>However, I found out that this kind of "interesting and productive" life wasn’t what I wanted. Therefore, I started to spend time on things that I am interested in. I spent time practicing my drawing skills, learning how to edit video clips, and working out to keep myself fit.</q> &#8594; <q><em>However, I found this "interesting" life to be in fact uninteresting, so I followed my heart and shifted my focus. I started to learn drawing and video-editing and work out regularly to get fitter.</em></q>

						<li>Avoid lengthy statements
