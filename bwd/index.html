				<h1>Introduction</h1>
				<p>Welcome to Bilingual Web Design offered in Fall 2020! Here's the introduction to this course to help you get ready.</p>
				<section>
					<h2>Why this course?</h2>
					<p>First of all, you probably want to learn some <em>practical</em> skills.</p>
					<p>Second, you need a Webpage to present your profile/works/personality.</p>
					<p>Third, Web Design helps cultivate your logical thinking and creativity.</p>
					<p>Finally, you still need to practice your English writing skills.</p>
				</section>
				<section>
					<h2>What to learn?</h2>
					<h3>HTML5, CSS, JavaScript(!!!)</h3>
					<p>HTML5 and CSS are probably more entertaining since you get to see what you create immediately. Javascript is perhaps a bit more <em>intimidating</em> - After all, computer programming sometimes means <em>a steep learning curve.</em></p>
