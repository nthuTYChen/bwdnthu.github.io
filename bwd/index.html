				<h1>Introduction</h1>
				<p>Welcome to Bilingual Web Design offered in Fall 2020! Here's the introduction to this course to help you get ready.</p>

					<h2 id="#whythiscourse">Why this course?</h2>
					<ul>
						<li>First of all, you probably want to learn some <em>practical</em> skills.</li>
						<li>Second, you need a Webpage to present your profile/works/personality.</li>
						<li>Third, Web Design helps cultivate your logical thinking and creativity.</li>
						<li>Finally, you still need to practice your English writing skills.</li>
					</ul>
				</section>

					<h2 id="whattolearn">What to learn?</h2>
					<h3>HTML5, CSS, JavaScript(!!!)</h3>
					<p>HTML5 and CSS are probably more entertaining since you get to see what you create immediately. JavaScript is perhaps a bit more <em>intimidating</em> - After all, computer programming sometimes means <em>a steep learning curve.</em></p>
					<p>But that's exactly why you're here, to step out of your comfort zone, and that's why I'm <em>teaching this course in Chinese</em> (the materials are still in English, though).</p>

					<h2 id="whatdoyouneed">What do you need?</h2>
					<ul>
						<li>A <em>GitHub account</em> to host your Webpage (see <a href="#preparationworks">Preparation</a> below). You can use the Web space provided by NTHU, but the Web address may look a bit <em>dumb</em> (for example: http://oz.nthu.edu.tw/~g10xxxxxx).</li>
						<li>Textbook...? <em>No</em>, you can just follow my materials. But there are two textbooks that are digitally accessible in the NTHU library database for your references:
							<em>
								<p>Murphy et al. (2012). Beginning HTML5 and CSS3: The Web Evolved. New York: Springer.</p>
								<p>Fielding, Jonathan. (2014). Beginning Responsive Web Design with HTML5 and CSS3. New York: Springer.</p>
							</em>
						</li>
						<li>A laptop/computer. Feel free to use the computer in C522, but you're encouraged to bring your own laptop for your own convenience and for <em>security reasons</em>.</li>
						<li>The Corpus of Comtemporary American English: <a href="https://www.english-corpora.org/coca/" target="blank">https://www.english-corpora.org/coca/</a></li>
						<li><em>Meticulous efforts and a tough mindset.</em></li>
					</ul>

					<h2 id="courserequirements">Course Requirements</h2>
					<p>Your performance in this course will be assessed with the following criteria:</p>
					<ul>
						<li><em>Attendance (10%)</em><br/>
							Unexcused absences would cost you this part of credit.
						</li>
						<li><em>Quiz (30%)</em><br/>
							Almost every lecture will end with a quiz. You will be assigned a Web design task and you need to complete it before the end of the lecture.
						</li>
						<li><em>Bilingual Personal Website (30%)</em><br/>
							You need to complete your own bilingual personal website by <em class="extra">Jan 15, 2021</em>. Your website will be assessed based on its aesthetic, structural, and programming features.
						</li>
						<li><em>Bilingual Thematic Website (30%)</em><br/>
							You need to design a bilingual website to present a topic of your choice, with an article written in both English and Chinese with an in-depth introduction to that topic. The website must be completed by <em class="extra">Jan 15, 2021</em>. The quality of your English writing will be assessed in addition to the Web design elements in it. <em class="extra">Plagiarism is strictly prohibited (you will get a zero)</em>.
						</li>
					</ul>
