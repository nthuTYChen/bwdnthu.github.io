				<h1>Introduction</h1>
				<p>Welcome to Bilingual Web Design offered in Fall 2020! Here's the introduction to this course to help you get ready.</p>

					<h2 id="#whythiscourse">Why this course?</h2>
					<ul>
						<li>First of all, you probably want to learn some <em>practical</em> skills.</li>
						<li>Second, you need a Webpage to present your profile/works/personality.</li>
						<li>Third, Web Design helps cultivate your logical thinking and creativity.</li>
						<li>Finally, you still need to practice your English writing skills.</li>
					</ul>
				</section>
				<section>
					<h2 id="whattolearn">What to learn?</h2>
					<h3>HTML5, CSS, JavaScript(!!!)</h3>
					<p>HTML5 and CSS are probably more entertaining since you get to see what you create immediately. JavaScript is perhaps a bit more <em>intimidating</em> - After all, computer programming sometimes means <em>a steep learning curve.</em></p>
					<p>But that's exactly why you're here, to step out of your comfort zone, and that's why I'm <em>teaching this course in Chinese</em> (the materials are still in English, though).</p>
				</section>
				<section>
					<h2 id="whatdoyouneed">What do you need?</h2>
					<ul>
						<li>A <em>GitHub account</em> to host your Webpage (see <a href="#preparationworks">Preparation</a> below). You can use the Web space provided by NTHU, but the Web address may look a bit <em>dumb</em> (for example: http://oz.nthu.edu.tw/~g10xxxxxx).</li>
						<li>Textbook...? <em>No</em>, you can just follow my materials. But there are two textbooks that are digitally accessible in the NTHU library database for your references:
							<em>
								<p>Murphy et al. (2012). Beginning HTML5 and CSS3: The Web Evolved. New York: Springer.</p>
								<p>Fielding, Jonathan. (2014). Beginning Responsive Web Design with HTML5 and CSS3. New York: Springer.</p>
							</em>
						</li>
						<li>A laptop/computer. Feel free to use the computer in C522, but you're encouraged to bring your own laptop for your own convenience and for <em>security reasons</em>.</li>
						<li>The Corpus of Contemporary American English: <a href="https://www.english-corpora.org/coca/" target="blank">https://www.english-corpora.org/coca/</a></li>
						<li><em>Meticulous efforts and a tough mindset.</em></li>
					</ul>

					<h2 id="courserequirements">Course Requirements</h2>
					<p>Your performance in this course will be assessed with the following criteria:</p>
					<ul>
						<li><em>Attendance (10%)</em><br/>
							Unexcused absences would cost you this part of credit.
						</li>
						<li><em>Quiz (30%)</em><br/>
							Almost every lecture will end with a quiz. You will be assigned a Web design task and you need to complete it before the end of the lecture.
						</li>
						<li><em>Bilingual Personal Website (30%)</em><br/>
							You need to complete your own bilingual personal website by <em class="extra">Jan 15, 2021</em>. Your website must include profile, autobiography, and one special section (for instance: working/travel experiences, honors, or some representative works). Your website will be assessed based on its aesthetic, structural, and programming features.
						</li>
						<li><em>Bilingual Thematic Website (30%)</em><br/>
							You need to design a bilingual website to present a topic of your choice, with an article written in both English and Chinese with an in-depth introduction to that topic. The website must be completed by <em class="extra">Jan 15, 2021</em>. The quality of your English writing will be assessed in addition to the Web design elements in it. <em class="extra">Plagiarism is strictly prohibited (you will get a zero)</em>.
						</li>
					</ul>

				<section>
					<h2 id="preparationworks">Preparation Works</h2>
					<ul>
						<li>Get a <a href="https://github.com" target="blank">GitHub account</a> to host your webpage. Your account will be part of your GitHub page domain name (https://xxxxxx.github.io, where xxxxxx is your account), so make it count.</li>
						<li>Download <a href="https://desktop.github.com/" target="blank">GitHub Desktop</a> to manage your Web design projects at GitHub. (Advanced: Take advantage of GitHub's <a href="https://education.github.com/pack#offers" target="blank">student pack</a>.)</li>
						<li>Get a text editor that can make your Web design process smoother: <a href="https://www.sublimetext.com/3" target="blank">Sublime Text</a> or <a href="https://notepad-plus-plus.org/downloads/" target="blank">Notepad++ (Windows Only)</a>.</li>
						<li>Follow the instruction at <a href="https://pages.github.com/" target="blank">GitHub Pages</a> to build a "repository" on your GitHub page (Choose "User or organization site" in 1 and "GitHub Desktop" in 2).</li>
						<li>Follow the instruction to clone your repository to your computer, create an <em class="extra">index.html</em> file, and Commit and Publish (Push Origin) to sync the changes to your repository.</li>
						<li>See if you can access to your GitHub page.</li>
					</ul>
				</section>

					<h2 id="moreongithub">More on GitHub</h2>
					<p>One nice thing about sync your project with GitHub is that GitHub allows you to track the changes you have made. Click on any file in your repository, and you would see the History button in the top-right corner:</p>

					</picture>
					<p>That's also the reason why you see + and - signs in your GitHub Desktop whenever you make and save some changes in your local respository:</p>

						<img src="img/localchanges.png"/>
					</picture>
					<p>As you move on, you'll make more and complex changes. And that's why you need to provide a good <em class="extra">Summary and Description</em> about the changes you make (this would also be vital in collaborative works):</p>

						<img src="img/summary.png"/>
					</picture>
					<p>GitHub has some other very nice and useful features, but know how these things work would be enough for you to work on your own in this course.</p>

					<p>Before you even start to think about the website you want to design, why not refer to some mesmerizing sites first for some insight?</p>
					<ul>

						<li><a href="http://www.mikiyakobayashi.com/" target="blank">Miyaka Kobayashi</a></li>

					<p>Which colors can represent you the best? Which colors do touch your heart the most? Are these colors <span style="background-color: #33cc33;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span style="background-color: #33cccc;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> visually harmonic? Or this color combination <span style="background-color: #ff6600;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span style="background-color: #009999;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> may not work for you? Feel it: <a href="https://coolors.co/palettes/trending" target="blank">Trending Color Palettes at Coolors.co</a></p>
					<p>In addition, a good Web design always comes with a proper choice of fonts: What is a good font for headings/sub-headings/contents? How to choose from hundreds of fonts generally offered by <a href="https://fonts.google.com/" target="blank">Google Fonts</a>?</p>

					<h2 id="forthenextunit">For the next unit...</h2>
					<p>For the next unit, you will have to complete the following tasks:</p>
					<ol>
						<li>Find a website that impresses you the most. You'll have to explain why you like it in the next lecture.</li>
						<li>Find a website that you think to have a poor design. You'll have to explain why, too.</li>
						<li>Decide the topic of your thematic website, and think of the outline of your writing and thus the structure of the website.</li>
						<li>Send me the link to your Web design project with the English spelling of your Chinese name <em class="extra">before the next class</em>, which will be shared in this website.</li>
					</ol>
					<p><button onclick="htmlbasics()">>> HTML Basics</button></p>
					<script>
						function htmlbasics() {
							$('nav a:nth-of-type(2)').trigger('click');
