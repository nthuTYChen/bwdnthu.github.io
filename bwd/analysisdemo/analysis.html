			<h1>Structure Analysis</h1>
			<p class="insNote"><em>Instructor's Note:</em> On this page, I will show how to analyze the essay about dementia. In your own project, you will have to follow this template to present your analysis.</p>
			<section>
				<h2>Thesis Statement</h2>
				<p class="insNote"><em>Instructor's Note:</em> Mark the thesis statement in the essay with the color code <span style="background-color: #80cdc1;">#80cdc1</span>, and explain why it is the thesis statement.</p>
				<p>In the opening paragraph <a href="example.html#sec1">[Sec. #1]</a>, the last sentence as highlighted in the following quotes would be the thesis statement for the two reasons. First, it contains the keyword <q>dementia</q>, which is discussed throughout the entire essay. In addition, the key phrases <q>before symptoms emerge</q> indicates that the focus will be on early detection of dementia.</p>
				<p class="quote"><q>Learning your odds of eventually developing dementia — a pressing concern for many, especially those with a family history of it — requires medical testing and counseling. But what if everyday behavior, like overlooking a couple of credit card payments or habitually braking while driving, could foretell your risk? A spate of experiments is underway to explore that possibility, reflecting the growing awareness that <span style="background-color: #80cdc1;">the pathologies underlying dementia can begin years or even decades before symptoms emerge</span>.</q></p>

				<h2>Essay Outline</h2>
				<p class="insNote"><em>Instructor's Note:</em> The essay outline is based on every section except the opening section. For each section, use one brief statement to summarize the subtopic and explain the reason.</p>
				<ul>
					<li><b><a href="example.html#sec2">[Sec. #2]</a> - Early detection is better than late treatments</b>
						<p>The topic of this section is made very clear in the first quoted statement in this section <q>Early detection is key</q>, and the rest of the section talks about why early detection is better, which is particularly indicated by the key phrase <q>the drugs are administered too late to be helpful</q>.</p></li>
					<li><b><a href="example.html#sec3">[Sec. #3]</a> - Current approaches are expensive and may be unavailable</b>
						<p>In the first statement of the section, the key phrase <q>For now</q> implies that this section focuses on the current approaches to the detection of dementia. Crucially, in the last statement, the author points of the problems with the current approaches using keywords or phrases like <q>expensive</q>, <q>invasive</q>, and <q>not available</q>.</p></li>
					<li><b><a href="example.html#sec4">[Sec. #4]</a> - Personal records are also indicative: A necessary evil?</b>
						<p>The section header is based on the three alternative indicators of early demetia involving personal records, which are discussed the first three paragraphs in this section with key phrases like <q>monitor driving behavior</q>, <q>consumer credit report</q>, and <q>scrutinizes phone conversations</q> in the first statement of each of the paragraphs. The second half of the header addresses the doubts regarding privacy raised in the last paragraph of the section, as indicated in its first statement <q>Such approaches raise concerns about privacy</q>.</p></li>
					<li><b><a href="example.html#sec5">[Sec. #5]</a> - Knowing to prepare for the worst</b>
						<p>The first statement of the section includes the main topic of the section, which is to <q>inform patients</q> and allow the patients to know their <q>risk</q>. Toward the end of the first paragraph of the section, the author writes some patients <q>responded to the information</q> and make some changes to their lifestyle to prepare for possible dementia in the future. The last paragraph is an actual patient talking about her story in line with this topic of this section.</p></li>
				</ul>
			</section>
			<section>
				<h2>Take-home Message</h2>
				<p class="insNote"><em>Instructor's Note:</em> Quote the paragraph where the take-home message is inferred from, and use one statement to summarize the take-home message and mark the statement with the color code <span style="background-color: #80cdc1;">#80cdc1</span>.</p>
				<p>In the last paragraph, the author quote the story from a participant taking part in the studies that investigate early indicators of dementia. In this story, the author's writing implies some positive aspects of understanding whether you have an early development of dementia. For example, the author shows that the odds of Alzheimer's disease is <q>lower than the participant had feared</q>. The author also quotes the participant's positive attitude toward the understanding of the risk despite the need to share their personal data, like <q>I would want to use them. I'd rather know than not</q>. Thus, we can see that in general, the author tries to convince people that <span style="background-color: #80cdc1;">there are more advantages than disadvantages to use your personal data to reveal your change of having dementia and to be ready for what would happen.</span></p>
				<p class="quote">Paul Gondek, 68, who lives in Philadelphia and teaches social psychology at Drexel University, chose to learn his risk status two years ago, volunteering for several studies at the Penn Memory Center. Alzheimer’s tends to run in families and, having watched his mother’s slow decline from the disease, he knew he had a higher chance of developing it. To Mr. Gondek’s relief, the PET scan showed that he did not have elevated amounts of amyloid in his brain. And a calculated risk score showed that his odds of Alzheimer’s by age 85 were about 19 percent — higher than the 11 percent risk for the general population, but lower than he had feared. If other early indicators were available through driving or financial records or other behaviors and were reliable, he said, “I would want to use them. I’d rather know than not.”</p>
