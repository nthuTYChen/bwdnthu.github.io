			<h1>Structure Analysis</h1>
			<p class="insNote"><em>Instructor's Note:</em> On this page, I will show how to analyze the essay about dementia. In your own project, you will have to follow this template to present your analysis.</p>
			<section>
				<h2>Thesis Statement</h2>
				<p class="insNote"><em>Instructor's Note:</em> Mark the thesis statement in the essay with the color code <span style="background-color: #80cdc1;">#80cdc1</span>, and explain why it is the thesis statement.</p>
				<p>In the opening paragraph <a href="example.html#sec1">[Sec. #1]</a>, the last sentence as highlighted in the following quotes would be the thesis statement for the two reasons. First, it contains the keyword <q>dementia</q>, which is discussed throughout the entire essay. In addition, the key phrases <q>before symptoms emerge</q> indicates that the focus will be on early detection of dementia.</p>
				<p class="quote"><q>Learning your odds of eventually developing dementia — a pressing concern for many, especially those with a family history of it — requires medical testing and counseling. But what if everyday behavior, like overlooking a couple of credit card payments or habitually braking while driving, could foretell your risk? A spate of experiments is underway to explore that possibility, reflecting the growing awareness that <span style="background-color: #80cdc1;">the pathologies underlying dementia can begin years or even decades before symptoms emerge</span>.</q></p>

				<h2>Essay Outline</h2>
				<p class="insNote"><em>Instructor's Note:</em> The essay outline is based on the body paragraphs, namely every section except the first and the last section. For each section, use one brief statement to summarize the subtopic and explain the reason.</p>
				<ul>
					<li><b><a href="example.html#sec2">[Sec. #2]</a> - Early detection is better than late treatments</b>
						<p>The subtopic is made very clear in the first quoted statement in this section <q>Early detection is key</q>, and the rest of the section talks about why early detection is better, which is particularly indicated by the key phrase <q>the drugs are administered too late to be helpful</q>.</p></li>
					<li><b><a href="example.html#sec3">[Sec. #3]</a> - Current approaches are expensive and may be unavailable</b></li>
					<li><b><a href="example.html#sec4">[Sec. #4]</a> - Driving, credit, and conversation records are possible indicators</b></li>
					<li><b><a href="example.html#sec5">[Sec. #5]</a> - Concerns over privacy: A necessary evil?</b></li>
				</ul>
