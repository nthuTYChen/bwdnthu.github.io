			<h1>Essay Analysis Guidelines</h1>
			<p class="insNote"><em>Instructor Note:</em> Here are the guidelines you will have to follow to analyze an expository essay that you choose for this project. For an example of how to apply these guidelines to complete your analysis, see the <a href="analysis.html">"Structural Analysis"</a> page.</p>
			<section>
				<h2>Thesis Statement</h2>
				<p>The first thing you need to do in your structural analysis is to identify the <b>thesis statement</b> in the essay. A thesis statement covers the main topic of the entire expository essay. It usually appears in the opening paragraph of a well-written expository essay as the first or last sentence, and you can always find keywords that matches (or are synonyms to) some words in the title of the essay.</p>
			</section>
			<section>
				<h2>Essay Outline</h2>
				<p>In your own version of the expository essay, you have tried to merge shorter paragraphs into larger ones, perhaps following your intuition. But what intuition did you follow exactly? It turns out the body paragraphs of a well-organized expository essay are always constructed based on logically ordered <b>subtopics</b>. Thus, for each <b>section</b> on your "Essay Example" page, you should use one brief sentence or phrase to summarize the subtopic of that section, and extract the keywords or key phrases in that section that are the cues of the subtopic.</p>
			</section>
			<section>
				<h2>Coherence</h2>
				<p>A good (expository) essay is writtent <b>coherently</b>, meaning that different paragraphs are well-connected and built around each subtopic and the main topic. For example, two paragraphs might support one idea together by discussing various aspects of the idea. In an essay with global warming as the main topic, two paragraphs may discuss the effects of greenhouse gas emission and deforestation. Both aspects form a subtopic (the factors) related to the main topic, so when the paragraph about greenhouse gas emission ends, the next paragraph about deforesting must be connected to the previous discussion:</p>
				<p><q>One major influence on the rising of the global temperature is an increase in the emission of greenhouse gas...The negative effect of greenhouse gas emission on global warming is exacerbated further with deforestation... </q></p>
				<p>In the above example, the first paragraph begins with <q>One major influence on the rising of the global temperature...</q> to make the subtopic explicit. Then, the second paragraph supports the previous paragraph firstly by repeating the main point of the previous paragraph at its beginning, that is, <q>The negative effect of greenhous gas emission on global warming...</q>, and this first sentence also uses the adverb <q>further</q> to tell the readers that an extension from the previous paragraph will be made.</p>
