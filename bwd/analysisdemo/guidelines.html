			<h1>Essay Analysis Guidelines</h1>
			<p class="insNote"><em>Instructor Note:</em> Here are the guidelines you will have to follow to analyze an expository essay that you choose for this project. For an example of how to apply these guidelines to complete your analysis, see the <a href="analysis.html">"Structural Analysis"</a> page.</p>
			<section>
				<h2>Thesis Statement</h2>
				<p>The first thing you need to do in your structural analysis is to identify the <b>thesis statement</b> in the essay. A thesis statement covers the main topic of the entire expository essay. It usually appears in the opening paragraph of a well-written expository essay as the first or last sentence, and you can always find keywords that matches (or are synonyms to) some words in the title of the essay.</p>
			</section>
			<section>
				<h2>Essay Outline</h2>
				<p>In your own version of the expository essay, you have tried to merge shorter paragraphs into larger ones, perhaps following your intuition. But what intuition did you follow exactly? It turns out the body paragraphs of a well-organized expository essay are always constructed based on logically ordered <b>subtopics</b>. Thus, for each <b>section</b> on your "Essay Example" page, you should use one brief sentence or phrase to summarize the subtopic of that section, and extract the keywords or key phrases in that section that are the cues of the subtopic.</p>
			</section>
			<section>
				<h2>Coherence</h2>
				<p>A good (expository) essay is written <b>coherently</b>, meaning that different paragraphs are well-connected and built around each subtopic and the main topic. The connection between two paragraphs is dependent on <b>the opening</b> of the second paragraph. For example, two paragraphs might support one idea together by discussing various aspects of the idea. In an essay with global warming as the main topic, two paragraphs may discuss the effects of greenhouse gas emission and deforestation. Both aspects form a subtopic (the factors) related to the main topic, so when the paragraph about greenhouse gas emission ends, the next paragraph about deforesting must be connected to the previous discussion:</p>
				<p class="quote"><q>[Para. #1] One major influence on the rising of the global temperature is an increase in the emission of greenhouse gas...[Para. #2] The negative effect of greenhouse gas emission on global warming is exacerbated further with deforestation... </q></p>
				<p>In the above example, the first paragraph begins with <q>One major influence on the rising of the global temperature...</q> to make the subtopic explicit. Then, the second paragraph supports the previous paragraph firstly by repeating the main point of the previous paragraph at its beginning, that is, <q>The negative effect of greenhous gas emission on global warming...</q>, and this first sentence also uses the adverb <q>further</q> to tell the readers that an extension from the previous paragraph will be made.</p>
				<p>Alternatively, the following paragraph might open with a statement showing a transition into a new subtopic. The statement might either use a different set of keywords that are still related to the main topic but not to the previous subtopic. For instance, following the discussion of deforestation, the next paragraph simply brings up another issue about global warming:</p>
				<p class="quote"><q>In recent years, the global warming has contributed to an impact on the world's economy...</q></p>
				<p>In the above statement, you can still see the key phrase of the main topic <q>global warming</q>, but you also see other new keywords unrelated to greenhouse gas or deforestation, which are <q>impact</q> and <q>economy</q>. This statement thus implies a transition into a new subtopic (probably the consequences of global warming), and that's the reason why you somehow think that a paragraph is the beginning of a new section.</p>
				<p>If you're lucky, you will see <b>linkers</b> that mark an explicit transition into a new subtopic, which save you some time inferring the author's intention, such as:</p>
				<p class="quote"><q>Despite these warning signs, no progress in alleviating the problem has been made...</q></p>
				<p class="quote"><q>Fortunately, green technology has evolved remarkably and become a viable solution to the problem...</q></p>
				<p>In the first opening statement above, the linker <q>despite</q> suggests a contrast made with a transition into a new subtopic discussing the lack of effort to fix <q>the problem</q>, which of course refers to global warming in this context. In the second opening statement above, the linker <q>fortunately</q> indicate a transition into a new subtopic, which is about <q>green technology</q> and a <q>solution</q> to <q>the problem</q>. Again, <q>the problem</q> links back to the main topic, so the coherence is not only for locally connected paragraphs, but also for the entire essay.</p>
				<p>This analysis is thus a practice for you to see the logic applied in English expository essay writing.</p>

				<h2>Cohesion</h2>
				<p><b>Cohesion</b> is very similar to coherence, which is about the logical connection between different parts of writing, but cohesion focuses on the connection between sentences <b>within</b> a paragraph. There are many techniques at one's disposal to make proper connections between sentences, including:</p>
				<ul>
					<li><b>Repetition</b> - Repeat keywords or phrases related to the currect topic.
						<p class="quote"><q>In recent years, <em>global warming</em> has been one of the major issues remained to be solved. <em>Global warming is threating since its impacts can be observed everywhere in our daily life.</em></q></p></li>
				</ul>
