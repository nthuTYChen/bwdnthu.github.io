			<p class="insNote"><em>Instructor Note:</em> Here are the guidelines you will have to follow to analyze an expository essay that you choose for this project. For an example of how to apply these guidelines to complete your analysis, see the <a href="analysis.html">"Structural Analysis"</a> page.</p>

It turns out the body paragraphs of a well-organized expository essay are always constructed based on logically ordered <b>subtopics</b>.</p>
