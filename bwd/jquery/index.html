				<p>Tired of juggling with crazily long JavaScript codes? Here's the tool to help you deal with your poor cognitive load.</p>

					<h2 id="#overview">Overview</h2>
					<p>All JavaScript codes make perfect sense: <code>addEventListener</code>? Sure. <code>document.querySelector()</code>? Fine. <code>document.getElementByTagName('div')[0].addEventListener()</code>? Probably a bit too much, right? Here's your savior: <em class="extra">jQuery</em> (<a href="https://jquery.com/" target="blank">https://jquery.com/</a>). It's still based on JavaScript, but it makes JavaScript programming much easier.</p>
					<p>Before introducing the basics of jQuery, let's try to embed jQuery into our website so we can use it. You can see different versions of jQuery at <a href="https://code.jquery.com/" target="blank">https://code.jquery.com/</a>, and of course we go for the most updated 3.x version. On this webpage, you would see various types of codes for jQuery Core, including <em>uncompressed</em>, <em>minified</em>, <em>slim</em>, and <em>slim minified</em>. There are two ways of incorporating jQuery into your website projects. First, we can use the <code>&lt;link&gt;</code> HTML tag inside <code>&lt;head&gt;&lt;/head&gt;</code> in an HTML document to retrieve the jQuery file from the official website (here <em>v3.5.1</em> is used as the example), just like how we linked a CSS file to our webpage:</p>

					<h3>HTML5, CSS, JavaScript(!!!)</h3>
					<p>HTML5 and CSS are probably more entertaining since you get to see what you create immediately. JavaScript is perhaps a bit more <em>intimidating</em> - After all, computer programming sometimes means <em>a steep learning curve.</em></p>
					<p>But that's exactly why you're here, to step out of your comfort zone, and that's why I'm <em>teaching this course in Chinese</em> (the materials are still in English, though).</p>

					<p>For the next unit, you will have to complete the following tasks:</p>
					<ol>
						<li>Find a website that impresses you the most. You'll have to explain why you like it in the next lecture.</li>
					</ol>
