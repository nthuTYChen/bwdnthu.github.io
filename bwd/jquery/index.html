					<p>All JavaScript codes make perfect sense: <code>addEventListener</code>? Sure. <code>document.querySelector()</code>? Fine. <code>document.getElementByTagName('div')[0].addEventListener()</code>? Probably a bit too much, right? Here's your savior: <em class="extra">jQuery</em> (<a href="https://jquery.com/" target="blank">https://jquery.com/</a>). It's still based on JavaScript, but it makes JavaScript programming much easier.</p>
					<p>Before introducing the basics of jQuery, let's try to embed jQuery into our website so we can use it. You can see different versions of jQuery at <a href="https://code.jquery.com/" target="blank">https://code.jquery.com/</a>, and of course we go for the most updated 3.x version. On this webpage, you would see various types of codes for jQuery Core, including <em>uncompressed</em>, <em>minified</em>, <em>slim</em>, and <em>slim minified</em>. Most people would probably use the <em class="extra">minified</em> version, which comes without any comments and with simplified codes and a reduced file size to facilitate data transmission. The <em>slim</em> versions further exclude some functions that are considered more marginal, such as those related to CSS animation, so for us they could be a bit oversimplified.</p>
					<h3>Get ready</h3>
					<p>There are two ways of incorporating jQuery into your website projects. First, we can use the <code>&lt;script&gt;</code> HTML tag inside <code>&lt;head&gt;&lt;/head&gt;</code> in an HTML document to retrieve the jQuery file from the official website (here <em>v3.5.1</em> is used as the example), just like how we linked a JS file to our webpage:</p>
					<code>
						&lt;script src="https://code.jquery.com/jquery-3.5.1.min.js"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
					</code>
					<p>Or, following the official suggestion, we should have the complete line below for security reasons:</p>
					<code>
						&lt;script src="https://code.jquery.com/jquery-3.5.1.min.js" integrity="sha256-9/aliU8dGd2tb6OSsuzixeV4y/faTqgFtohetphbbj0=" crossorigin="anonymous"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
					</code>
					<p>You can move the above line into <code>&lt;body&gt;&lt;/body&gt;</code>, which may not affect how your website works eventually. But to be safe, it is still the best idea to have the above line inside <code>&lt;head&gt;&lt;/head&gt;</code> as part of the metadata of a webpage, which is always loaded first. Crucially, if you have any jQuery codes to be run when the <em>Document Object Model (DOM)</em> of the webpage is ready, then the jQuery file <em class="extra">must</em> be linked inside <code>&lt;body&gt;&lt;/body&gt;</code> so it is guaranteed to be fully loaded before the DOM is ready. Or, your website may not work properly since the jQuery codes are run when the jQuery file is still on its way.</p>
					<p>Alternatively, if your Web space can afford an additional file sized just a few hundreds KBs, which is likely the case if you host your website at GitHub, then why not just download the entire jQuery Core file and put it in your own website? One benefit of doing this is that you don't rely on the external source of your jQuery Core file, so your website remains unaffected even when the official jQuery website is down (very unlikely, but who knows?). So assuming that you have a <code>js</code> directory under the <em class="extra">root</em> directory <code>/</code> as suggested in previous units, we can store the jQuery Core file to that directory. Again, the files you store in the subdirectories directly under the root directory are assumed to be used globally in your entire website, rather than specifically for a given webpage. Now, we can embed the following HTML codes inside <code>&lt;head&gt;&lt;/head&gt;</code> to load the jQuery file stored in your own website into your webpage:</p>
					<code>
						&lt;!-- The first "/" in the path refers to the root directory --&gt;
						&lt;script src="/js/jquery-3.5.1.min.js"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
					</code>
					<p>Because from now on, your codes will be based on the jQuery Core file, your links to other JS files you have for a particular webpage must follow the above lines used to load the jQuery Core file. Once again, if you have any jQuery codes that need to be run at the very beginning after a webpage is loaded, then you want to be sure that the jQuery Core file is loaded first.</p>
					<p>So, now you're ready to enjoy Web programming even more, and I'm here to help. This won't be a complete guide, so just in case that you want to know further about what jQuery can make things easier, check the full jQuery API documentation at <a href="https://api.jquery.com/" target="blank">https://api.jquery.com/</a>.</p>

					<h3>HTML5, CSS, JavaScript(!!!)</h3>
					<p>HTML5 and CSS are probably more entertaining since you get to see what you create immediately. JavaScript is perhaps a bit more <em>intimidating</em> - After all, computer programming sometimes means <em>a steep learning curve.</em></p>
					<p>But that's exactly why you're here, to step out of your comfort zone, and that's why I'm <em>teaching this course in Chinese</em> (the materials are still in English, though).</p>
