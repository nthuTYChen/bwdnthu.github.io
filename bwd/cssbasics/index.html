					Let's take a look at some English writing issues I found in your autobiography, so you can keep improving the quality in the future.

					<h2 id="cascading">Style sheet, understood. But "cascading"?</h2>
					<p>These are the relevant definitions of <em>cascade</em> as a verb from <a href="https://www.oxfordlearnersdictionaries.com/definition/english/cascade_2?q=cascading" target="blank">Oxford Learner's Dictionary</a>:</p>
					<p><q>to flow downwards in large amounts</q></p>
					<p><q>to pass information, knowledge, etc. to a person or group so that they can pass it on to others; to be passed on in this way</q></p>
					<p>Remember that in the <em>Document Object Model (DOM)</em>, we can define the relationship between HTML elements. In a style sheet, when you specify the style of a parent, the style would <em>cascade down</em>, <em>flow downwards</em>, or <em>pass on</em> to it children, until the <em>flow</em> encounters a different style (that is, you specify a different style for the children).</p>
					<p>In the following HTML document, for instance, if <code>&lt;html&gt;</code> is specified to have a black background, it's <em>child</em> <code>&lt;div&gt;</code> will also <em>inherit</em> this style, unless you specify a different background color for it - the style <em>flow</em> is stopped.</p>
					<code>
						<table>
							<tbody>
								<tr>
									<td>&lt;body&gt;</td><td></td>
								</tr>
								<tr>
									<td></td><td>&lt;div&gt;</td>
								</tr>
								<tr>
									<td></td><td>&lt;/div&gt;</td>
								</tr>
								<tr>
									<td>&lt;/body&gt;</td><td></td>
								</tr>
							</tbody>
						</table>
					</code>
					<p>The most updated CSS system is CSS3, although we would mostly use the features that are well-developed following W3C standards from early on. There are also many new stuff in CSS3 that can create some very fancy effects in your webpage. But again, be very careful when you try to use them because some might be too new to be supported in all major Web browsers. <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/Reference#Keyword_index" target="blank">MDN Web Docs</a> still provides you a very complete CSS guide that you should always refer to.</p>
