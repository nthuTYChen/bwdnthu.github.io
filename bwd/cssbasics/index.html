				<p><em>Cascading Style Sheet</em> - that's what CSS means, which is the flesh of your HTML document (or, the dress it wears). Most of simple website projects could be done with HTML and CSS alone, just like this course website. <em class="extra">Surprise!</em></p>

					Let's take a look at some English writing issues I found in your autobiography, so you can keep improving the quality in the future.

					<h2 id="cascading">Style sheet, understood. But "cascading"?</h2>
					<p>These are the relevant definitions of <em>cascade</em> as a verb from <a href="https://www.oxfordlearnersdictionaries.com/definition/english/cascade_2?q=cascading" target="blank">Oxford Learner's Dictionary</a>:</p>
					<p><q>to flow downwards in large amounts</q></p>
					<p><q>to pass information, knowledge, etc. to a person or group so that they can pass it on to others; to be passed on in this way</q></p>

					<p>Remember that in the <em>Document Object Model (DOM)</em>, we can define the relationship between HTML elements. In a style sheet, when you specify the style of a parent, the style would <em>cascade down</em>, <em>flow downwards</em>, or <em>pass on</em> to its children, until the <em>flow</em> encounters a different style (that is, you specify a different style for the children).</p>
					<p>In the following HTML document, for instance, if <code>&lt;html&gt;</code> is specified to have a black background, it's <em>child</em> <code>&lt;div&gt;</code> will also <em>inherit</em> this style, unless you specify a different background color for it - the style <em>flow</em> is stopped.</p>
					<table>
						<tbody>
							<tr>
								<td>&lt;body&gt;</td><td></td>
							</tr>
							<tr>
								<td></td><td>&lt;div&gt;</td>
							</tr>
							<tr>
								<td></td><td>&lt;/div&gt;</td>
							</tr>
							<tr>
								<td>&lt;/body&gt;</td><td></td>
							</tr>
						</tbody>

					<p>The most updated CSS system is CSS3, although we would mostly use the features that are well-developed following W3C standards from early on. There are also many new stuff in CSS3 that can create some very fancy effects in your webpage. But again, be very careful when you try to use them because some might be too new to be supported in all major Web browsers. <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/Reference#Keyword_index" target="blank">MDN Web Docs</a> still provides you a very complete CSS guide that you should always refer to.</p>
				</section>
				<section>
					<h2 id="globalthinking">Global thinking, efficient execution</h2>
					<p>In the previous unit, I talked about how to organize the files in your website, which is part of the global thinking required for your Web development project. I told you that when you create a <em>css</em> directory in the <em>root</em> directory of a website project, it has the implication that the styles specified in the CSS files in this directory would apply to the entire website, presumably because, for instance, you have the same navigation pane in different webpages. You probably don't want to include styles that are specific to some elements in some specific webpages that belongs to a specific sub-project - these styles should go to a CSS file located in the <em>css</em> directory of the sub-project folder, which is only loaded when those specific webpages are presented in a Web browser.</p>
					<p>Let me again use my course website as an example. In the file structure below, I have a <em>bwd</em> directory and a <em>meteor</em> directory right under the <em>root</em> directory because I have two course sub-projects. Under the <em>root</em> directory, I have a <em>css</em> directory for global CSS files, because I assume that my <em>bwd</em> and <em>meteor</em> would have a similar layout (for instance, the same style for the navigation pane) and I only need one CSS file for these common styles. But I also expect both projects to have some unique presentation of their contents, which requires some styles that are not useful for the other project, and I would put them into a CSS file in the <em>css</em> directory of each sub-project.</p>
					<table>
						<tr>
							<td>/ (root)</td><td>─ index.html (default homepage)</td><td></td>
						</tr>
						<tr>
							<td></td><td>┕ /css (global css files)</td><td></td>
						</tr>
						<tr>
							<td></td><td>┕ /bwd (bwd project folder)</td><td>─ index.html (course default homepage)</td>
						</tr>
						<tr>
							<td></td><td></td><td>┕ /css (bwd css files)</td>
						</tr>
						<tr>
							<td></td><td>┕ /meteor (meteor project folder)</td><td>─ index.html (course default homepage)</td>
						</tr>
						<tr>
							<td></td><td></td><td>┕ /css (meteor css files)</td>
						</tr>
					</table>
					<h3>Are these manipulations crucial?</h3>
					<p>Maybe, depending on the scale of your Web development project. It's not about the performance of your website, because modern computers are very powerful, and most of time you probably won't feel the difference in whether a website loads a tiny CSS file with only essential styles or a sizable one with lots of <em>redundancies</em>. Things could go wild very easily, however. The less planning you do, the more time you could waste on fixing problems.</p>
				</section>
				<section>
					<h2 id="csssyntax">CSS syntax, a breakdown</h2>
					<p>OK, enough life lessons. Let's first create a <em>css</em> directory <em class="extra">inside</em> your <em>cv</em> directory (because I'm assuming that your themetic website will look very distinct), and then create a <em>style.css</em> file in the <em>css</em> directory. The filename is not going to matter, but you always have to choose a <em>sensible</em> one - what could be more sensible to name the file <em>style.css</em> if the file is really just for styling...? (Let's agree to disagree). In the CSS file, the syntax of a given style should look like this:</p>
					<table>
						<tbody>
							<tr>
								<td>selector {</td><td></td>
							</tr>
							<tr>
								<td></td><td>property: value;</td>
							</tr>
							<tr>
								<td>}</td><td></td>
							</tr>
						</tbody>
					</table>
					<p>In the above style template, <em class="extra">selector</em> allows a Web browser to pin down a group of elements or one single specific element in a DOM. The curved brackets <code>{ }</code> defines the scope of a style, in which the value of properties of the style are specified. There are many CSS properties for you to change the visual representation of a webpage, such background color, font color, font style...just too many of them. We usually use one line for every single property which <em class="extra">must</em> ends with a semi-colon <code>;</code>, and in each line, the name of the property and its value must be separated by a colon <code>:</code>. Did you happen to notice the indention at the beginning of a property line, and know why this is recommended? In addition, we can still add some notes that will not be considered part of styling for our own reference with the following line:</p>
					<code>/* some notes in a CSS file! */</code>
					<p>Let's try to create your very first style and apply it to your personal website. In your <em>style.css</em> for the personal website, add the following style so the background of <code>&lt;body&gt;</code> will have a pink color.</p>
					<table>
						<tbody>
							<tr>
								<td>body {</td><td></td>
							</tr>
							<tr>
								<td></td><td>background-color: pink;</td>
							</tr>
							<tr>
								<td>}</td><td></td>
							</tr>
						</tbody>
					</table>
					<p>Now link the CSS file to <em>index.html</em> by adding the following line into <code>&lt;head&gt;&lt;/head&gt;</code>so the default homepage would be styled based on the CSS file. Note that in our case, the path in this link does not begin with <code>/</code>, because the CSS file is not located in a <em>css</em> directory under the <em>root</em> directory. Instead, the CSS file is located in the <em>css</em> directory in your <em>cv</em> directory, along with the <em>index.html</em> file it styles. This type of paths is called <em class="extra">relative</em> path, because the path to the linked CSS file is <em>relative</em> to the HTML file.</p>
					<code>&lt;link rel="stylesheet" href="css/style.css"&gt;</code>
					<p>If you've done everything correctly, you should see the fancy pink color in the background of the homepage of your personal website. And you would observe the <em class="extra">cascading effect</em>, too; every element inside <code>&lt;body&gt;</code> has a pink backgroud. Let's try to stop this cascading effect by specifying a different background color for the <em>children</em> of <code>&lt;body&gt;</code>...say, <code>&lt;section&gt;</code>...? Add the following style to the <em>style.css</em> file, and you will see the contrast. Most of the elements inside <code>&lt;body&gt;</code> still has a pink background, except for every single <code>&lt;section&gt;</code> element (and it's children), which now has a white background.</p>
					<table>
						<tbody>
							<tr>
								<td>section {</td><td></td>
							</tr>
							<tr>
								<td></td><td>background-color: white;</td>
							</tr>
							<tr>
								<td>}</td><td></td>
							</tr>
						</tbody>
					</table>
					<h3>The &lt;style&gt; element and inline styling</h3>
					<p>If you search for some information about CSS on the internet, you probably will see two alternative methods of styling the elements directly inside your HTML files. The first one is to define the styles directly inside the <code>&lt;style&gt;&lt;/style&gt;</code> element, which is then inserted into <code>&lt;head&gt;&lt;/head&gt;</code> as part of the metadata of a webpage, as in the following example:</p>
					<table>
						<tbody>
							<tr>
								<td>&lt;style&gt;</td><td></td><td></td>
							</tr>
							<tr>
								<td></td><td>body {</td><td></td>
							</tr>
							<tr>
								<td></td><td></td><td>background-color: pink;</td>
							</tr>
							<tr>
								<td></td><td>}</td><td></td>
							</tr>
							<tr>
								<td>&lt;/style&gt;</td><td></td><td></td>
							</tr>
						</tbody>
					</table>
					<p>This would be useful when you have some styles that are only applicable to the elements in a webpage. But I personally wouldn't recommend it. If later you decide to extend these styles to other webpages, you still need to move them to a CSS file so you don't have to repeat these styles again and again in different HTML files.</p>
					<p>Alternatively, you could put CSS properties in the value of the <em>style</em> attribute of an HTML element (namely, <em class="extra">inline styling</em>) to style that particular element, as in the following example:</p>
					<code>&lt;body style="background-color: pink;"&gt;</code>
					<p>This technique would be useful if you need some special presentation for just <em>one</em> element, and you're pretty sure that you won't use it anywhere else. In this course website, I need to present some special examples from time to time, which requires some CSS styles just for these examples. This is the case where I choose to just use inline styling, because the styles are not going to be reused again. However, if you have lots of properties to specified even just for a single element, you'd better define this style in a CSS file since it would be easier to read in the source code. We will return to inline styling later in this unit.</p>

					<h2 id="experimenting">Experimenting different styles</h2>
					<p>When you begin to style your webpages, you naturally keep adjusting the properties until you settle down on the layout that you're satisfied with. Normally, this means to constantly make changes to your CSS file in a text editor, upload it to your website, and check the changes in your Web browser. There is nevertheless a hidden tool in your Web browser that you can use to experiment and examine changes in real time, which is mostly called <em class="extra">Developer Tools</em>. Well, you may have come across it in your Web browser when you hit <em class="extra">F12</em> by accident and didn't know what to do with it:</p>
					<picture>
						<img src="img/devtools.png"/>
					</picture>
					<p>For a simple Web design project, there are two very useful sections in the Developer Tools. One is <em class="extra">Elements</em>, and the other is <em class="extra">Console</em>. Let's focus on <em>Elements</em> first, in which you will see the HTML elements and their structure in your webpage. When you click on an element, its style will appear in the <em class="extra">Styles</em> panel on the right. In the <em>Styles</em> panel, you can freely add new styles or adjust the existing ones, and the changes will apply to the current webpage accordingly.</p>
					<p>Thus, with this tool, you could experiment some styling directly in your webpage first, and then make the same changes to your CSS file when you're contented. This will save you some time because you don't need to blindly change your CSS file repeatedly.</p>
