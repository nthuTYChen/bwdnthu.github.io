				<p><em>Cascading Style Sheet</em> - that's what CSS means, which is the flesh of your HTML document (or, the dress it wears). Most of simple website projects could be done with HTML and CSS alone, just like this course website. <em class="extra">Surprise!</em></p>

					<h2 id="cascading">Style sheet, understood. But "cascading"?</h2>
					<p>These are the relevant definitions of <em>cascade</em> as a verb from <a href="https://www.oxfordlearnersdictionaries.com/definition/english/cascade_2?q=cascading" target="blank">Oxford Learner's Dictionary</a>:</p>
					<p><q>to flow downwards in large amounts</q></p>
					<p><q>to pass information, knowledge, etc. to a person or group so that they can pass it on to others; to be passed on in this way</q></p>

					<p>Remember that in the <em>Document Object Model (DOM)</em>, we can define the relationship between HTML elements. In a style sheet, when you specify the style of a parent, the style would <em>cascade down</em>, <em>flow downwards</em>, or <em>pass on</em> to its children, until the <em>flow</em> encounters a different style (that is, you specify a different style for the children).</p>
					<p>In the following HTML document, for instance, if <code>&lt;html&gt;</code> is specified to have a black background, it's <em>child</em> <code>&lt;div&gt;</code> will also <em>inherit</em> this style, unless you specify a different background color for it - the style <em>flow</em> is stopped.</p>
					<table>
						<tbody>
							<tr>
								<td>&lt;body&gt;</td><td></td>
							</tr>
							<tr>
								<td></td><td>&lt;div&gt;</td>
							</tr>
							<tr>
								<td></td><td>&lt;/div&gt;</td>
							</tr>
							<tr>
								<td>&lt;/body&gt;</td><td></td>
							</tr>
						</tbody>
					</table>
					<p>The most updated CSS system is CSS3, although we would mostly use the features that are well-developed following W3C standards from early on. There are also many new stuff in CSS3 that can create some very fancy effects in your webpage. But again, be very careful when you try to use them because some might be too new to be supported in all major Web browsers. <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/Reference#Keyword_index" target="blank">MDN Web Docs</a> still provides you a very complete CSS guide that you should always refer to.</p>
				</section>
				<section>
					<h2 id="globalthinking">Global thinking, efficient execution</h2>
					<p>In the previous unit, I talked about how to organize the files in your website, which is part of the global thinking required for your Web development project. I told you that when you create a <em>css</em> directory in the <em>root</em> directory of a website project, it has the implication that the styles specified in the CSS files in this directory would apply to the entire website, presumably because, for instance, you have the same navigation pane in different webpages. You probably don't want to include styles that are specific to some elements in some specific webpages that belongs to a specific sub-project - these styles should go to a CSS file located in the <em>css</em> directory of the sub-project folder, which is only loaded when those specific webpages are presented in a Web browser.</p>
					<p>Let me again use my course website as an example. In the file structure below, I have a <em>bwd</em> directory and a <em>meteor</em> directory right under the <em>root</em> directory because I have two course sub-projects. Under the <em>root</em> directory, I have a <em>css</em> directory for global CSS files, because I assume that my <em>bwd</em> and <em>meteor</em> would have a similar layout (for instance, the same style for the navigation pane) and I only need one CSS file for these common styles. But I also expect both projects to have some unique presentation of their contents, which requires some styles that are not useful for the other project, and I would put them into a CSS file in the <em>css</em> directory of each sub-project.</p>
					<table>
						<tr>
							<td>/ (root)</td><td>─ index.html (default homepage)</td><td></td>
						</tr>
						<tr>
							<td></td><td>┕ /css (global css files)</td><td></td>
						</tr>
						<tr>
							<td></td><td>┕ /bwd (bwd project folder)</td><td>─ index.html (course default homepage)</td>
						</tr>
						<tr>
							<td></td><td></td><td>┕ /css (bwd css files)</td>
						</tr>
						<tr>
							<td></td><td>┕ /meteor (meteor project folder)</td><td>─ index.html (course default homepage)</td>
						</tr>
						<tr>
							<td></td><td></td><td>┕ /css (meteor css files)</td>
						</tr>
					</table>
					<h3>Are these manipulations crucial?</h3>
					<p>Maybe, depending on the scale of your Web development project. It's not about the performance of your website, because modern computers are very powerful, and most of time you probably won't feel the difference in whether a website loads a tiny CSS file with only essential styles or a sizable one with lots of <em>redundancies</em>. Things could go wild very easily, however. The less planning you do, the more time you could waste on fixing problems.</p>
				</section>
				<section>
					<h2 id="csssyntax">CSS syntax, a breakdown</h2>
					<p>OK, enough life lessons. Let's first create a <em>css</em> directory <em class="extra">inside</em> your <em>cv</em> directory (because I'm assuming that your themetic website will look very distinct), and then create a <em>style.css</em> file in the <em>css</em> directory. The filename is not going to matter, but you always have to choose a <em>sensible</em> one - what could be more sensible to name the file <em>style.css</em> if the file is really just for styling...? (Let's agree to disagree). In the CSS file, the syntax of a given style should look like this:</p>
					<table>
						<tbody>
							<tr>
								<td>selector {</td><td></td>
							</tr>
							<tr>
								<td></td><td>property: value;</td>
							</tr>
							<tr>
								<td>}</td><td></td>
							</tr>
						</tbody>
					</table>
					<p>In the above style template, <em class="extra">selector</em> allows a Web browser to pin down a group of elements or one single specific element in a DOM. The curved brackets <code>{ }</code> defines the scope of a style, in which the value of properties of the style are specified. There are many CSS properties for you to change the visual representation of a webpage, such background color, font color, font style...just too many of them. We usually use one line for every single property which <em class="extra">must</em> ends with a semi-colon <code>;</code>, and in each line, the name of the property and its value must be separated by a colon <code>:</code>. Did you happen to notice the indention at the beginning of a property line, and know why this is recommended? In addition, we can still add some notes that will not be considered part of styling for our own reference with the following line:</p>
					<code>/* some notes in a CSS file! */</code>
					<p>Let's try to create your very first style and apply it to your personal website. In your <em>style.css</em> for the personal website, add the following style so the background of <code>&lt;body&gt;</code> will have a pink color.</p>
					<table>
						<tbody>
							<tr>
								<td>body {</td><td></td>
							</tr>
							<tr>
								<td></td><td>background-color: pink;</td>
							</tr>
							<tr>
								<td>}</td><td></td>
							</tr>
						</tbody>
					</table>
					<p>Now link the CSS file to <em>index.html</em> by adding the following line into <code>&lt;head&gt;&lt;/head&gt;</code>so the default homepage would be styled based on the CSS file. Note that in our case, the path in this link does not begin with <code>/</code>, because the CSS file is not located in a <em>css</em> directory under the <em>root</em> directory. Instead, the CSS file is located in the <em>css</em> directory in your <em>cv</em> directory, along with the <em>index.html</em> file it styles. This type of paths is called <em class="extra">relative</em> path, because the path to the linked CSS file is <em>relative</em> to the HTML file.</p>
					<code>&lt;link rel="stylesheet" href="css/style.css"&gt;</code>
					<p>If you've done everything correctly, you should see the fancy pink color in the background of the homepage of your personal website. And you would observe the <em class="extra">cascading effect</em>, too; every element inside <code>&lt;body&gt;</code> has a pink backgroud. Let's try to stop this cascading effect by specifying a different background color for the <em>children</em> of <code>&lt;body&gt;</code>...say, <code>&lt;section&gt;</code>...? Add the following style to the <em>style.css</em> file, and you will see the contrast. Most of the elements inside <code>&lt;body&gt;</code> still has a pink background, except for every single <code>&lt;section&gt;</code> element (and it's children), which now has a white background.</p>
					<table>
						<tbody>
							<tr>
								<td>section {</td><td></td>
							</tr>
							<tr>
								<td></td><td>background-color: white;</td>
							</tr>
							<tr>
								<td>}</td><td></td>
							</tr>
						</tbody>
					</table>
					<h3>The &lt;style&gt; element and inline styling</h3>
					<p>If you search for some information about CSS on the internet, you probably will see two alternative methods of styling the elements directly inside your HTML files. The first one is to define the styles directly inside the <code>&lt;style&gt;&lt;/style&gt;</code> element, which is then inserted into <code>&lt;head&gt;&lt;/head&gt;</code> as part of the metadata of a webpage, as in the following example:</p>
					<table>
						<tbody>
							<tr>
								<td>&lt;style&gt;</td><td></td><td></td>
							</tr>
							<tr>
								<td></td><td>body {</td><td></td>
							</tr>
							<tr>
								<td></td><td></td><td>background-color: pink;</td>
							</tr>
							<tr>
								<td></td><td>}</td><td></td>
							</tr>
							<tr>
								<td>&lt;/style&gt;</td><td></td><td></td>
							</tr>
						</tbody>
					</table>
					<p>This would be useful when you have some styles that are only applicable to the elements in a webpage. But I personally wouldn't recommend it. If later you decide to extend these styles to other webpages, you still need to move them to a CSS file so you don't have to repeat these styles again and again in different HTML files.</p>
					<p>Alternatively, you could put CSS properties in the value of the <em>style</em> attribute of an HTML element (namely, <em class="extra">inline styling</em>) to style that particular element, as in the following example:</p>
					<code>&lt;body style="background-color: pink;"&gt;</code>
					<p>This technique would be useful if you need some special presentation for just <em>one</em> element, and you're pretty sure that you won't use it anywhere else. In this course website, I need to present some special examples from time to time, which requires some CSS styles just for these examples. This is the case where I choose to just use inline styling, because the styles are not going to be reused again. However, if you have lots of properties to specified even just for a single element, you'd better define this style in a CSS file since it would be easier to read in the source code. We will return to inline styling later in this unit.</p>

				<section>
					<h2 id="experimenting">Experimenting different styles</h2>
					<p>When you begin to style your webpages, you naturally keep adjusting the properties until you settle down on the layout that you're satisfied with. Normally, this means to constantly make changes to your CSS file in a text editor, upload it to your website, and check the changes in your Web browser. There is nevertheless a hidden tool in your Web browser that you can use to experiment and examine changes in real time, which is mostly called <em class="extra">Developer Tools</em>. Well, you may have come across it in your Web browser when you hit <em class="extra">F12</em> by accident and didn't know what to do with it:</p>
					<picture>
						<img src="img/devtools.png"/>
					</picture>
					<p>For a simple Web design project, there are two very useful sections in the Developer Tools. One is <em class="extra">Elements</em>, and the other is <em class="extra">Console</em>. Let's focus on <em>Elements</em> first, in which you will see the HTML elements and their structure in your webpage. When you click on an element, its style will appear in the <em class="extra">Styles</em> panel on the right. In the <em>Styles</em> panel, you can freely add new styles or adjust the existing ones, and the changes will apply to the current webpage accordingly.</p>
					<p>Thus, with this tool, you could experiment some styling directly in your webpage first, and then make the same changes to your CSS file when you're contented. This will save you some time because you don't need to blindly change your CSS file repeatedly.</p>
				</section>
				<section>
					<h2 id="fontcolors">Fonts and colors</h2>
					<p>You don't just use the same font in a website, not only because your website could look boring, but also because texts in a webpage generally convey different messages - titles, headings, menu items, paragraphs...They all need be made distinct so readers know what they are looking at. In this course website, I use five different fonts: One for the (page) title using the first-level heading <code>&lt;h1&gt;</code>, two for the second-level and third-level heading <code>&lt;h2&gt;</code> and <code>&lt;h3&gt;</code> respectively, one for the texts in full paragraphs, and one more for examples that mostly involve some source codes. Of course, you don't use too many fonts in your website either to avoid making reading impossible.</p>
					<p>At the very beginning, I've already asked you to explore <a href="https://fonts.google.com/" target="blank">Google Fonts</a> to see what kind of fonts you favor. Unsurprisingly, there are more fonts for English than for other languages, given the relatively small number of characters the developers need to create. For <em>Traditional Chinese</em>, we only have two choices <em>Noto Sans TC</em> and <em>Noto Serif TC</em>, but they are still <em>way more pretty</em> than the build-in Chinese fonts in some operating systems. Plus, it's free, so we cannot ask for more from Google.</p>
					<p>In Google Fonts, you can click on a font you like, and select the font style you need. You can include all the fonts and their styles in a list at once. Then, in a panel on the right side of the webpage, you will see the <em class="extra">Embed</em> option as in the figure below, which provides two methods of introducing the selected fonts to your website.</p>
					<picture>
						<img src="img/googlefonts.png"/>
					</picture>
					<p>The first method provides you a line of <code>&lt;link&gt;</code> codes, which you can put into the <code>&lt;head&gt;</code> element as part of the metadata of your website:</p>
					<p><code>&lt;link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css2?family=Roboto:wght@300&display=swap" rel="stylesheet"&gt;</code></p>
					<p>The second method provides you a line of <code>@import</code> codes, which you can put into the first line of your global/local CSS file (it is in fact embedded inside the <code>&lt;style&gt;</code> element which is supposed to be inserted into <code>&lt;head&gt;</code>, but I already explain why this might not be the best idea):</p>
					<p><code>@import url('https://fonts.googleapis.com/css2?family=Roboto:wght@300&display=swap');</code></p>
					<p>I personally always prefer the second method, since the font styles I choose are usually applied across all webpages. Since I already have to load the global/local CSS file for every webpage, why don't I just load the font styles from Google in my CSS file, so I don't have to repeat the <code>&lt;link&gt;</code> codes in the metadata of every webpage.</p>
					<h3>How do you choose fonts?</h3>
					<p>Hmm, good question. I'm no typographer, so I generally follow the rule of thumb and then pick the fonts I feel appropriate (so I could be wrong, and you need to dig deeper by yourself). All fonts could be categorized as either <em class="extra">Serif</em> or <em class="extra">Sans-serif</em>. The former type has small strokes attached to the end of main strokes (as in the fonts you're seeing now in this website), which give the characters more details. It is believed that serif fonts are easier to read than sans-serif fonts, especially in print, which is also the reason that they are commonly applied to body texts. Sans-serif fonts, without those extended small strokes, usually have square or round edges at the end of a stroke. They are usually used for large-size texts such as headings, rather than for body texts.</p>
					<p>So, if you want to play safe, just follow the above rules, and the texts in your website should look just fine. Whenever you need to choose multiple serif or sans-serif fonts, you probably don't want to pick those that look very different, because you want some visual consistency in your website, too. Of course, bold combinations could have some unexpected positive effects, but I'm not the one to guide you. However, Google Fonts do give you some hint; In each font webpage, you'll see popular parings, and you could follow these suggestions:</p>
					<picture>
						<img src="img/popularpairings.png"/>
					</picture>
					<p>After you make your decision and embedded the essential codes into your website to load the fonts, you should also <em>add some notes</em> to your CSS file to remind yourself which font is for which part of texts in your website, just like what I do for mine, too:</p>
					<code>
						<p>/*</p>
						<p> Main Title/h1: Mukta</p>
						<p> h2: Dosis</p>
						<p> h3: Thasadith</p>
						<p> body: Zilla Slab</p>
						<p> code: Lekton</p>
						<p>*/</p>
					</code>
					<p>When you need to apply a font style to an element, add the <code>font-family</code> property to the style you defined in your CSS file, just like:</p>
					<p><code>font-family: 'Zilla Slab', serif;</code></p>
					<p>In this property, you can specify more than one fonts separated using a <em>comma</em>. A Web browser will try to apply the first font style, and if the first style is not available, it will try the second one, and so on, until it finds an available font style. In the above example, I added <em>serif</em> as the last resort, so a Web browser to use whatever serif font available to it when there's no other available choice. You should instead add <em>sans-serif</em> at the end if other specified fonts in the same line are also sans-serif, so some consistencies could be maintained, although the replacement would not give the best look of your website.</p>
					<p>Now, take some time to get the font part done. You can surely change your mind later, but your initial attempt might not be bad at all!</p>
					<h3>A colorful world</h3>
					<p>There are more decisions to make, and this time it's about the colors in your website. Colors undoubtedly have their visual/emotional impacts, you need to choose them wisely. Again, I'm not expert, but the keywords for you to google would be <em class="extra">psychology of colors</em>. For this course website, I just followed my instinct to use the combination of red, organge, green, and black colors. Red and organge stand out because I use them to put an emphasis on various elements, so they become the theme of my website - McDonald's uses this color combination, too, so don't judge!</p>
					<p>You don't use colors just to make your website look fancier than others. Colors are just like fonts, which would help convey <em class="extra">systematic messages</em> of your website, such as:</p>
					<ul>
						<li>The theme of a webpage.</li>
						<li>The highlights in a webpage.</li>
						<li>Distinct sections in a webpage.</li>
						<li>Etc.</li>
					</ul>
					<p>In CSS, you can specify a color in many different ways. One is to use the word that represents a color, such as black, red, and pink, which we have tried earlier. There's no much flexibility with this method since the subtly difference in colors cannot be specified using words in CSS. Alternatively, most Web designers would choose to use <em class="extra">RGB value or HEX code</em> to specify a color:</p>
					<code>
						<p>background-color: rgb(0, 0, 0); /* both represents a black color */</p>
						<p>background-color: #000000;</p>
					</code>
					<p>I've never received any professional training in digital art, so I choose to use the HEX system only because it's easier to type. You can make your own choice based on what you know (or like) for sure. OK, let's set the tone for your website, and don't forget to add some note in your CSS file to remind you the function of each color of your choice, such as:</p>
					<code>
						<p>/*</p>
						<p>text color: #383838; (light grey)</p>
						<p>link color: #cccccc; (super-light grey)</p>
						<p>link hovered color: #000000; (black)</p>
						<p>menu bg color: #b30000; (dark red)</p>
						<p>section bg color: #f2f2f2 (lighter grey);</p>
						<p>highlight color: #e68a00; (dark orange)</p>
						<p>code color:#226d6d; (cyan)</p>
						<p>*/</p>
					</code>
				</section>
				<section>
					<h2 id="cssunits">CSS Units</h2>
					<p>You must have been waiting for a tutorial for how to adjust the size of texts and elements in your website, and there you go! There are different units in a CSS file that you can use to define the size, distance, width, height, etc., and we'll start with <em class="extra">absolute length units</em> (from <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/CSSref/css_units.asp" target="blank">W3CSchool</a>). They are absolute because the units refer to an absolute scale and are not dependent of other specified lengths in an HTML document. Among the units in the following list, <em>px</em> is probably the most frequently used absolute length unit in Web design - the screen resolution is defined by pixels and the dimension of an image is commonly specified with pixel, too. When we learn to use JavaScript to retrieve the dimension of an element, you get pixel as the measure by default. Again, I could be wrong, but when referring to pixel, I also feel more comfortable with estimating the size of an element in an webpage across different devices.</p>
					<ul>
						<li><code>cm</code> - centimeters</li>
						<li><code>mm</code> - millimeters</li>
						<li><code>in</code> - inches (1in = 96px = 2.54cm)</li>
						<li><code>px</code> - pixels (1px = 1/96th of 1in)</li>
						<li><code>pt</code> - points (1pt = 1/72 of 1in)</li>
						<li><code>pc</code> - picas (1pc = 12pt = 1/6 of 1in)</li>
					</ul>
					<p>Many things could be either <em class="extra">absolute</em> or <em class="extra">relative</em>, just like the path to a file that we have discussed previously, so it's natural that we have <em class="extra">relative length units</em> as in the following list, too. When you use a relative length unit, the actual length is relative to some other length. For instance, if the font size of a <code>&lt;div&gt;</code> element is set to <code>16px</code>, and you want emphasized texts in the element are twice larger, then you could set the font size of the emphasized texts to <code>2em</code>.Well, you could simply use <code>32px</code>, too, but soon you will find this strategy very inefficient because every time you change the base font size, you need to change all associated font sizes.</p>
					<ul>
						<li><code>em</code> - relative to the font size of the current element</li>
						<li><code>rem</code> - relative to the font size of the <em>root</em> element</li>
						<li><code>vw</code> - relative to 1% of the viewport (the browser window size) width</li>
						<li><code>vh</code> - relative to 1% of the viewport height</li>
						<li><code>vmin</code> - relative to 1% of the smaller viewport dimension</li>
						<li><code>vmax</code> - relative to 1% of the larger viewport dimension</li>
						<li><code>%</code> - relative to the parent element</li>
					</ul>
					<p>My own strategy is even more radical. In some cases, I even start with the relative length unit as the base to make sure that the webpage is in general consistent across different devices. For instance, I might set the base font size to <code>1.5vh</code>, that is <em>1.5% of the browser window height</em>, so whether the screen width is 1920px, 768px, or 1280px, the font size is <em>proportionally the same</em> on a webpage. Then, the size of emphasized texts could be set to <code>2em</code>, which is equivalent to <code>3vh</code>. This strategy is also the foundation of <em class="extra">Responsive Web Design</em>, which focuses on providing a <em>unified</em> browsing experience for your website. We will be back to this a few weeks later.</p>
					<p>One final thing about length unit is the complication that stems from the <em class="extra">border</em> of an element. It is common an element is decorated with borders for its edge to be visible, but now you need to choose if the calculation of height/width of the element includes the borders or not. If not, you choose to measure/define height/width with a <em class="extra">content-box</em>, which gives you the dimention of the red area in the block below. Alternatively, you could choose to measure/define the dimension of a <em class="extra">border-box</em>, which takes borders (the blue edges in below) into consideration.</p>
					<div style="height: 10vw; width: 10vw; border: 5px solid blue; background-color: red;">
					</div>
					<h3>Border-box or content-box?</h3>
					<p>It might be more logical to adopt <em>border-box</em> as a default, since normally you wouldn't evaluate the dimension of an element by excluding its borders. For instance, when you want to clear an area on your wall to hang a beautful <em>framed</em> picture, you wouldn't just think about the dimension of the picture itself, but also the borders created with the frame, right? This would be mostly irrelevant because not many elements need borders, and the edge of an element could be made distinct in many different ways (by setting a background color, for example). But for now, let's make <em>border-box</em> as the default for <em>all</em> elements in your webpage by setting following style in your CSS file (the selector <code>*</code> is a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wildcard_character" target+"blank">wild card character</a> that means <em class="extra">any character</em>, which thus selects every elements):</p>
					<table>
						<tbody>
							<tr>
								<td>* {</td><td></td>
							</tr>
							<tr>
								<td></td><td>box-sizing: border-box;</td>
							</tr>
							<tr>
								<td>}</td><td></td>
							</tr>
						</tbody>
